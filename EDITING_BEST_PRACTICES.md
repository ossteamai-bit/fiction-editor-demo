# Fiction Editing Best Practices
## From The Chicago Guides to Editing Fiction

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

### The Fiction Editor's Three Mottoes (Schneider)

#### 1. "It's Not My Book"
**Meaning:** Respect the author's choices. Fiction has many valid grammar and punctuation styles.

**In Practice:**
- Don't rewrite to match your personal preference
- Don't impose your moral code on content
- Don't take over the storytelling
- Focus on mechanical editing, not creative critique
- Query problems, don't assume fixes

**Example Violations:**
- ❌ Changing "She run" to "She ran" in dialect dialogue
- ❌ Removing profanity because you're uncomfortable with it
- ❌ Rewriting passages to "improve" the prose
- ✅ Querying: "Character speaks formal English here but dialect elsewhere - intentional?"

---

#### 2. "Is This How People Talk?"
**Meaning:** Don't "correct" informal, natural speech to formal grammar.

**In Practice:**
- Dialogue should sound authentic, not stilted
- First-person narration often uses dialogue-like informality
- Characters have different education levels and speech patterns
- Regional dialects and accents should be preserved
- Written notes, texts, emails are casual like speech

**Example Violations:**
- ❌ "Correcting" "'Cause I wanna" to "Because I want to" in dialogue
- ❌ Fixing "Me and him went" to "He and I went" when character speaks informally
- ❌ Removing sentence fragments from first-person narration
- ✅ Preserving: "You gotta be kidding me. No way. Not happening."

---

#### 3. "If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It"
**Meaning:** Don't rewrite to avoid tricky grammar. Don't fix intentionally "broke" elements.

**In Practice:**
- Brush up on grammar to edit without changing author's intent
- Recognize intentional rule-breaking for effect
- Don't be overly pedantic
- Focus on clarity, not perfection
- Leave unfamiliar-but-legitimate words alone

**Example Violations:**
- ❌ Rewriting complex sentence to avoid semicolon judgment call
- ❌ "Correcting" intentional comma splices for pacing
- ❌ Changing legitimate but uncommon word because you haven't heard it
- ✅ Looking up unfamiliar words before querying

### The Developmental Editing Process

#### STAGE 1: Concept (Norton Ch. 1)
**Goal:** Clarify the central concept and vision

**Key Tasks:**
- Locate the core concept/premise
- Profile the target audience specifically
- Evaluate market potential honestly
- Bring the vision into sharp focus
- Ensure concept is compelling and clear

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is this story really about (in one sentence)?
- Who will want to read this, and why?
- What makes this unique in its genre?
- What's the emotional core that will resonate?

---

#### STAGE 2: Content (Norton Ch. 2)
**Goal:** Assess the manuscript's potential

**Key Tasks:**
- Size up the author (experience, goals, strengths)
- Size up the publisher (expectations, house style)
- Create a comprehensive content summary
- Find the main subject/focus
- Identify what needs to stay vs. what can go

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is there too much or too little content?

---

#### STAGE 3: Thesis (Norton Ch. 3)
**Goal:** Identify and sharpen the central theme

**Key Tasks:**
- Cull potential theses from topics

- Ensure the theme is clear but not heavy-handed

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is this story saying about the human condition?
- Why does this story matter?
- What's the emotional truth beneath the plot?
- How do recurring elements support the thesis?

---

#### STAGE 4: Narrative Structure (Norton Ch. 4)
**Goal:** Optimize the timeline and structure

**Key Tasks:**
- Untangle timelines from thematic arguments
- Identify all timelines (main plot, subplots, flashbacks)
- Brainstorm timeline strategies (linear, non-linear, parallel)
- Compose the optimal timeline
- Fine-tune the timeline for pacing and clarity

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is the timeline serving the story or confusing readers?
- Are flashbacks necessary and clear?
- Do multiple timelines need better signposting?

**Goal:** Fill gaps and smooth connections

**Key Tasks:**
- Create strong opening transitions (chapter/scene starts)
- Create satisfying closing transitions (endings)
- Draw clear conclusions where needed
- Place those conclusions strategically
- Ensure logical flow between sections

**Questions to Ask:**

## ✏️ COPYEDITING FICTION (Schneider)

### The Copyeditor's Mindset

#### What Fiction Copyediting IS NOT:

1. **Not Your Chance to Pretend You're the Author**
   - Don't try to take over the storytelling
   - Don't critique the work (that's developmental editing)
   - Your job is mechanical only
   - Too late to worry about character development or pacing
   - Stick to your agreed scope

2. **Not the Place to Apply Your Moral Code**
   - You may encounter content you find objectionable
   - Edit it respectfully and professionally
   - If you can't give it full professional attention, decline the project
   - Your job: edit the text, not judge it

3. **Not the Time to Apply Your Grammar Hammer**
   - Fiction grammar is much more fluid than nonfiction
   - Authors invent words, break rules intentionally
   - Characters don't speak "correct" English
   - Balance house style against author's voice
   - Know when it's okay (necessary) to break rules

---

### Breaking the Rules in Fiction

#### When Rules Don't Apply:

**1. Comma Splices**
- **Allowed:** Creating pace, tension, character voice, casual feel
- **Example:** "I don't know, I can't remember, it was so long ago."
- **Don't "Fix"** unless it causes genuine confusion

**2. Sentence Fragments**
- **Allowed:** Emphasis, pace, internal thought, style
- **Example:** "She left. Just like that. No goodbye."
- **Don't "Fix"** unless it creates ambiguity

**3. Repetition**
- **Allowed:** Emphasis, rhythm, character voice, emotional impact
- **Example:** "Run. Run. Run!"
- **Don't "Fix"** - often very deliberate

**4. Informal Language**
- **Dialogue:** Almost always informal, broken, interrupted
- **First-person narration:** Usually dialogue-level informal
- **Written notes/texts/emails:** Casual, just like speech
- **Don't "Fix"** informal to formal

**5. Non-Standard Grammar**
- **Characters:** Have accents, dialects, education levels, quirks
- **Narrators:** May have distinct voice separate from "proper" English
- **Don't "Fix"** unless passage is genuinely unclear

---

### Zombie Rules to Kill (Schneider)

**These "rules" aren't actually rules:**

- ✅ Can split infinitives: "to boldly go"
- ✅ Can end sentences with prepositions: "What are you looking at?"
- ✅ "Over" can mean "more than" (not just "physically above")
- ✅ "Decimate" can mean "destroy" (not just "reduce by 1/10")
- ✅ "Between" works for more than two items
- ✅ "Impact" can be used as a verb
- ✅ Singular "they" is increasingly standard
- ✅ "Who" is replacing "whom" in all but most formal writing

**Embrace linguistic evolution. Edit descriptively, not prescriptively.**

---

### Internal Consistency (Schneider Ch. 1)

#### The Copyeditor as Continuity Supervisor

**Goal:** Everything must fit the logic of the world created

**What to Track:**

1. **Character Consistency**
   - Name spellings (watch for variants like Jon/John)
   - Physical descriptions (hair color, height, etc.)
   - Background details (birthplace, education, family)
   - Speech patterns and vocabulary
   - Relationships and dynamics
   - Character knowledge (what they know/when they learned it)

2. **Place Consistency**
   - Location names and spellings
   - Geographic relationships (what's near what)
   - Physical descriptions (layout, appearance)
   - Internal geography (where things are in a building/city)
   - Real vs. fictionalized places

3. **Timeline Consistency**
   - Event sequences (what happened when)
   - Character ages and aging
   - Technology/culture matching time period
   - Season/weather matching dates
   - Time passage (days/weeks/months/years)
   - Flashback placement and duration

4. **Object/Detail Consistency**
   - Invented technology or magic systems
   - Fictional terms and proper nouns
   - Object descriptions
   - Rules of the fictional world

**Critical Rule:** The manuscript serves as its own reference source.

### Style Sheet Creation (Schneider Part II)

#### Components of a Fiction Style Sheet

**1. General Style** (Ch. 3)
- Punctuation choices (serial comma, dialogue style, em dash use)
- Spelling preferences (US vs. UK, -ize vs. -ise)
- Capitalization (job titles, honorifics, etc.)
- Number handling (spell out vs. numerals)
- Italics usage (emphasis, thoughts, foreign words)
- Special terms (unique to this manuscript)

**2. Characters** (Ch. 4)
```
Name: Aya Amrani
- Physical: 5'6", dark hair, green eyes, athletic build
- Background: Born Istanbul, now lives London
- Speech: Direct, occasionally uses Turkish phrases
- Quirks: Twirls ring when nervous
- Relationships: Best friend to Amina, complicated with father
- First appearance: Chapter 1, page 3
- Other: Surname sometimes appears as "Amrami" - standardize to "Amrani"
```

**3. Places** (Ch. 5)
```
Location: Galata Tower, Istanbul
- Description: Medieval stone tower, 67 meters tall, spiral staircase
- Geography: Galata neighborhood, north of Golden Horn
- Fictional elements: Secret chamber in foundation (not real)
- First appearance: Chapter 5
- Notes: Real location with fictionalized features
```

**4. Timeline** (Ch. 6)
```
Day 1: Monday, June 15
- Morning: Aya finds artifact in Atlas Mountains
- Afternoon: Flight to Istanbul
- Evening: Meets Amina at Galata Tower

Day 2: Tuesday, June 16
- Dawn: Discovers chamber
- Noon: Confrontation with Malik
```

### Grammar & Usage in Fiction (Schneider Ch. 7)

#### Key Principles:

**1. Context Determines Correctness**
- What's wrong in narration may be right in dialogue
- First-person narration follows dialogue-like rules
- Genre conventions matter (literary vs. thriller pacing)
- Character voice trumps technical correctness

**2. Clarity is the Goal**
- Fix genuine confusion
- Don't fix style variation
- Query ambiguous passages
- Respect intentional difficulty

**3. Garden-Path Sentences**
These genuinely need fixing because they mislead readers:
- ❌ "The horse raced past the barn fell."
- ❌ "The man who whistles tunes pianos."
- ✅ Fix these even if technically grammatical

**4. Show vs. Tell**
- Not your job to enforce "show don't tell"
- Some telling is necessary and appropriate
- Query excessive telling only if it slows story significantly

---

### Dialogue (Schneider Ch. 8)

#### Essential Principles:

**1. Dialogue Must Sound Natural**
- Real speech is fragmented, interrupted, informal
- People repeat themselves
- People say "um," "uh," "like"
- People use incorrect grammar spontaneously
- **Don't "fix" natural speech patterns**

**2. Each Character Needs Distinct Voice**
- Different vocabulary levels
- Different speech patterns/rhythms
- Different dialect or accent markers
- Different formality levels
- Check: Can you identify speaker without dialogue tags?

**3. Dialogue Punctuation**
- Consistency is key (pick a style, stick with it)
- Common US style: Commas and periods inside quotes
- UK style differs: Logical punctuation
- Action beats vs. dialogue tags (both are valid)

**Examples:**
```
✅ "I'm leaving," she said.           [Standard US tag]
✅ "I'm leaving." She grabbed her coat. [Action beat]
✅ She grabbed her coat. "I'm leaving." [Action beat reversed]
```

**4. Dialogue Tags**
- "Said" is invisible and fine
- Occasional variations okay: asked, whispered, shouted
- Avoid fancy alternatives: ejaculated, retorted, opined
- Some writers use only "said" and action beats
- **Respect author's choice**

**5. Dialect and Accent**
- Track consistency (character-specific patterns)
- Respect author's approach (light touch vs. phonetic)
- Don't "correct" dialect to standard English
- Add dialect markers to style sheet

---

### Fact-Checking Fiction (Schneider Ch. 9)

#### Balancing Real and Fictional

**What to Verify:**

1. **Historical Facts**
   - Dates of real events
   - Historical figures' real actions
   - Period-appropriate technology
   - Cultural/social norms of the era
   - Political situations

2. **Geographic Facts**
   - Real place descriptions (if used)
   - Travel times and distances
   - Directions and relationships
   - Landmarks and features

3. **Technical Details**
   - Technology capabilities/limitations
   - Scientific accuracy (unless deliberately fantasy)
   - Professional procedures and terminology
   - Brand names and trademarks

4. **Cultural Details**
   - Language and translation
   - Customs and social norms
   - Religious practices
   - Food and cuisine

**When to Query vs. Let Stand:**

**Query if:**
- Clear factual error (mountains where there are none)
- Impossible timeline (character can't get from A to B in stated time)
- Anachronism that seems unintentional
- Technical detail that breaks immersion for knowledgeable readers
- Contradiction with established history

**Let Stand if:**
- Author has deliberately fictionalized a real place
- Speculative technology in sci-fi
- Magic/supernatural in fantasy
- Alternate history scenario
- Author has indicated "inspired by" rather than "exactly like"

**Always Query, Never Assume:**
```
❌ Don't: "The Eiffel Tower wasn't built until 1889, so I changed 1850 to 1890."
✅ Do: "Query: The Eiffel Tower wasn't completed until 1889. Should this scene be set later, or is the location fictional?"
```

## 🎨 GENRE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Thriller/Action-Adventure (Dan Brown Style)

**Developmental Focus:**
- **Pacing:** Relentless forward momentum
- **Chapter Endings:** Every chapter ends on hook/cliffhanger
- **Sentence Rhythm:** Short during action, longer during exposition
- **Information:** Complex info broken into digestible chunks
- **Structure:** Race against time built into plot

**Copyediting Focus:**
- **Fact-Check:** Historical/scientific details must be accurate
- **Timeline:** Minute-by-minute precision often needed
- **Geography:** Travel times and routes must be realistic
- **Technology:** Capabilities must match time period
- **Consistency:** Track complex plot threads carefully

---

### Historical Fiction

**Developmental Focus:**
- **Research Balance:** Enough detail to feel authentic, not overwhelming
- **Anachronisms:** Intentional vs. accidental
- **Voice:** Period-appropriate without being archaic
- **Pacing:** Historical context vs. plot momentum

**Copyediting Focus:**
- **Historical Accuracy:** Dates, events, people, technology
- **Language:** Period-appropriate vocabulary and idioms
- **Culture:** Accurate social norms and customs
- **Details:** Clothing, food, transportation, money, etc.
- **Timeline:** Ensure stated dates align with historical events

---

### Fantasy/Speculative

**Developmental Focus:**
- **World-building:** Consistent rules and logic
- **Magic Systems:** Clear limitations and costs
- **Info-dumps:** Avoid; weave in organically
- **Stakes:** Make consequences of magic/tech clear

**Copyediting Focus:**
- **Internal Consistency:** Track invented terms, magic rules, geography
- **Proper Nouns:** Create comprehensive list of all fictional names
- **Capitalization:** Consistent treatment of made-up terms
- **World Logic:** Verify actions align with established rules
- **Style Sheet:** Extensive tracking of invented elements

---

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### For Developmental Editors:

1. **Over-editing:** Trying to fix everything instead of focusing on high-impact issues
2. **Losing Author's Voice:** Rewriting too much, imposing your style
3. **Lack of Plan:** Proceeding without clear goals and milestones
4. **Scope Creep:** Expanding beyond agreed-upon scope
5. **Not Listening:** Imposing solutions without author input

### For Copyeditors:

1. **Grammar Hammer:** "Correcting" intentional stylistic choices
2. **Over-querying:** Questioning every small thing instead of using judgment
3. **Under-querying:** Assuming you understand author's intent
4. **Inconsistent Approach:** Applying standards inconsistently
5. **Missing Context:** Not considering genre/voice/style conventions
6. **Fact-Checking Without Research:** Assuming errors without verifying
7. **Imposing Preferences:** Changing things to match your taste

## 💡 FINAL WISDOM

**From Schneider:**
> "The copyeditor is like the continuity supervisor on a movie set. Everything must fit the logic of the world the author has created."

**From Norton:**
> "The best DEs learn from each encounter with an author and continually refine their process. To put it bluntly, the goal is to outgrow this handbook."

**The Golden Rule:**
**Serve the story. Support the author. Respect the reader.**
