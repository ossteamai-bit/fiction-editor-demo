Chapter 1
A hooded silhouette stood motionless amid the flowing river of pedestrians, watching.
"Karim," Aya whispered, holding her gaze firmly on the table. "Three o'clock. Don't be obvious."
The blue neon of Yana Café cast an electric haze across the tiled terrace, transforming the evening crowd into silhouettes against the amber glow inside. Aya Amrani lifted her Turkish coffee, inhaling the cardamom-laced steam before taking a careful sip. 
Karim stiffened. "I don’t see anything," he whispered. “We only landed a few hours ago. How could they already be onto us?”
"Building corner. Hooded figure." Aya tilted her head toward Amina on her right, who was scrolling through her phone with affected boredom. "Amina, do you clock them?"
Amina Said glanced up, her expression bored as she scanned the street with practiced nonchalance. The faded markings on her forearm, remnants of their encounter with a djinn in Morocco just over two weeks ago, were visible beneath her pushed-up sleeves. She took a long sip of her mint tea before answering.
Before flying to Turkey, the three of them had witnessed the opening of a sealed crypt in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains and watched djinn materialize before their eyes from another plane of existence. Aegis had funded the dig, hoping the Amulet of Idris could tap raw energy from the djinn’s realm to rewrite the world’s power grid. 
Instead, the spirits unleashed nearly caused environmental collapse across Morocco, took their friend Abdelatif with them into the void, and forced them to destroy the amulet before the death toll spread beyond Morocco. They escaped with scars: Amina’s permanent mark that still tingled like static, Karim’s nightmares of being trapped in the collapsing tunnel system beneath the Atlas Mountains. 
Aegis had lost its super-battery as their base went into full meltdown in the Sahara, but not its appetite. Now, the shadowy organization that had pulled their strings wanted another relic, and Istanbul’s streets were the next hunting ground.
"Yeah, I’ve noticed him," Amina said as a roguish grin shot across her face. "He’s been there since just after we arrived. Hasn’t moved. I’ll deal with him, habibi."
Amina moved to stand, but Aya's hand shot out, gripping her wrist. "Don't. Too many witnesses."
"I wasn't going to create a scene," Amina argued, but settled back into her chair. “I hate sitting around waiting.”
Karim, unable to resist, turned his head fully toward the figure. By the time his eyes found the spot, there was nothing but empty space where the watcher had stood. "I think they're gone," he said, turning back to the table. “Did you see where they went?”
"No. Perfect timing," Aya said, banging her fist on the table. "Just as we start paying attention."
"Salah warned us they'd be here," Karim said quietly. "Aegis doesn't let go."
"Then they're after the same thing we are." Aya's jaw tightened. "The Lens."
Amina's hand drifted toward the markings on her arm. "We beat them to it. I'm not interested in a repeat of Morocco."
"Neither am I," Aya said. "That's why we're here."
The waiter, a lanky kid with a long ponytail and a barrage of silver earrings, glided up, carrying a sweating pitcher.
“Başka bir şey ister misiniz?” he asked.
“Şimdilik sadece su, teşekkürler,” Karim answered.
The waiter refilled their water glasses and was gone.
"Nice Turkish," Aya said, pushing Karim’s shoulder.
"A few weeks of intensive study will do that," Karim replied with a smirk. "But it’s really not good. Still, the basics might be useful, and there wasn’t any more research I could do until we were here on the ground."
"Better than my pathetic attempts." Aya leaned forward, lowering her voice. "So, are we going to talk about the plan here?"
"Dismantling a global shadow organization that's hunting ancient artifacts of immense power with only your father’s incomplete research as our guide? It’s not complicated," Amina said dryly. "Just another Tuesday."
Karim laughed. “Oh yes, and just the simple revelation that djinn are real, and who knows what other supernatural terrors await...” His voice trailed off, but they all felt the weight of his unfinished thought.
"That's why we're here," Aya said. "To make sure it never happens again. The Astral Lens, if we’re right and that’s what they’re after in Turkey, stays out of their hands."
Amina's dark eyes flicked to Aya's face, then away. "Quite the career change we’ve had. Though I’m not sure I like the new benefits package."
“People do change,” Aya said, fingers drumming the handle of her cup. “Six months ago, I’d have stolen the Lens and sold it to some megalomaniac like Léglise.”
Amina’s mouth curved into a half-smirk. “Radical rebranding: Aya Amrani, inconveniently heroic.”
Karim laughed. “Hero or thief, labels are flexible. I, for one, still consider myself an archaeologist and historian. But what matters is we’re a team now, and we have an enemy to stop. The three of us here, plus Salah and Omar.”
“Then I suppose we won’t waste time arguing old résumés. Or thinking about past experiences too much.” Amina’s gaze lingered on Aya before sliding away. Amina rubbed at the markings on her arm, which looked to any outsider like a series of Amazigh-inspired tattoos.
"How have they been?" Aya asked quietly, nodding toward Amina's arm.
Amina's hand stilled. "Manageable."
"That's not what I asked."
"They hurt sometimes," Amina admitted. "More when I dream. It wakes me up."
Aya felt an urge to reach across the table, to offer comfort, to wrap her former partner in an embrace. But that was the past. Before everything had changed. Before Karim. The murky waters of their new dynamic made her hesitate, her hand hovering momentarily before retreating to her coffee cup.
Karim cleared his throat, clearly sensing the sudden shift in atmosphere. "Should we head back to drop off our things? It’s time to check into the apartment, and there's still daylight to explore our new neighborhood. Who knows how long we’ll be here."
"Always the practical one," Aya said. “Yeah, it’ll be good to at least enjoy the area before we have our next steps."
They settled their bill and stepped out onto the tiled streetside terrace of the café, now getting much busier than when they'd arrived. The early evening air carried a hint of salt water from the nearby port, mixed with the aromas pouring out of restaurants’ open windows.
A ten-minute walk later, they were climbing the stairs to the fourth floor of a hilltop Ottoman building near Moda. The trendy neighborhood on Istanbul's Asian side was a world away from the tourist-packed streets of Taksim across the water. The apartment door opened to reveal a stylish living space with a blend of contemporary furnishings and traditional architecture. Three comfortable sofas surrounded a wooden coffee table, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering sweeping views over the sprawling city.
"Omar outdid himself," Aya said, moving immediately to the windows and pulling one open to let in the breeze. The rooftops of Kadıköy spread before them, the Bosphorus glittering in the distance, and beyond that, the silhouette of Istanbul's European side with its minarets and towers puncturing the darkening sky.
Somewhere out there, hidden in the bones of this ancient city, lay the Astral Lens, the device her father had spent years researching before his death. Çelebi's masterwork. Capable of channeling energy from deep space itself, focusing power that made the Amulet of Idris look like a spark beside a bonfire.
If Aegis found it first, Morocco would indeed be a footnote.
The plan was simple: find the Lens before they did, then vanish. Leave Turkey. Hide the components somewhere Aegis would never reach. Guard them forever if necessary. No activation, no catastrophe, no more supernatural fallout.
Her father had died before finishing his research. Now it was hers to complete. And to bury.
"Not bad for a carpet salesman," Amina said.
"Well, he’s always been just a bit more than a carpet salesman," Aya said with a laugh. "And hopefully his connections are as invaluable as he thinks."
Karim threw open the sliding terrace doors. “So far,” he said, taking in the view, “I have complete faith in him.”
"I'll take this room," Amina said, claiming the bedroom closest to the fire escape.
“Three exits,” Aya noted. “Not bad.”
Karim tilted his head toward the next room, with another terrace and views out over the Bosphorus. “That one’s huge. Care to share?”
Aya smirked. “You need to ask?”
He shrugged and scratched his head. “Professional courtesy.”
Amina’s voice drifted from her doorway. “You two negotiate sleeping arrangements; I’m testing the fire escape, just in case.”
Aya tossed her a salute, then turned to Karim. “Try not to steal all the blankets this time.”
“No promises.”
They stashed their passports in a hollow book, slid their notebooks and research beneath a couch cushion, and rigged Amina’s micro-tripwire across the terrace door.
Karim snapped the last sensor into place. “Perimeter secure. Time for some street reconnaissance? I've been reading about Tellalzade Street," he said. "It's not far, and it’s known for vintage shops and record stores. And Kadıköy Square is supposed to be amazing this time of day. We could check those out, then get dinner?"
Aya took a long look, surveying the apartment and their security measures. Satisfied, she nodded.
"Lead the way, Professor," Amina said.
They spent the next hour wandering through Kadıköy's streets. The district felt crowded and alive, but relaxed. Students with colorfully dyed hair moved between cafés, street musicians competed with the sounds of conversations and laughter, vendors sold everything from antique books to handcrafted jewelry, while packed bars and restaurants dotted every corner. 
The streets themselves were a maze. Some wide boulevards were lined with plane trees; other narrow alleys were barely wide enough for two people to pass, but all sloped dramatically toward the Sea of Marmara below. When they reached Tellalzade Street, it charmed them with narrow passages lined with shops selling vintage clothing, antique cameras, and records from decades past. 
Aya watched with amusement as Karim excitedly examined a collection of Ottoman-era photographs, remarking on every detail. "So you’re in your element?" she asked when he finally tore himself away.
"A couple of months ago, I was analyzing pottery shards in the dust and heat with no prospect of it ever meaning anything," Karim said, taking her hand as they walked. "Now I'm on an adventure in Istanbul, a place I’ve always wanted to visit, tracking an ancient Lens with mysterious powers, along with two beautiful master thieves. Life is not bad.”
Amina was several paces behind them, either examining a shop window with intense focus or deliberately giving them space. Aya couldn’t decide. The distance she maintained wasn't just physical. Since they had defeated Léglise and sealed the djinn away for good in the Atlas, Amina had kept an emotional barrier firmly in place.
"I don’t know what’s up with her," Aya said quietly. “She has flashes of normalcy, but then she’s so distant.”
"She’s still processing. And aren't we all?" Karim said. “She’ll come around.”
They continued to Kadıköy Square, and the energy intensified. Street performers entertained crowds with acrobatics, and food vendors filled the air with the smell of grilled meat. Near the tram stop, a vendor in a red fez rang a brass bell, flipping his elastic ice-cream cones on a long metal paddle just out of reach of giggling tourists. 
A clarinetist accompanied by a saz player threaded a haunting Anatolian melody through the square; every so often, the clarinet swooped into a jazz-like riff that set the crowd clapping. A drummer with a worn davul kept the pulse, his heel stomping the pavement.
As they walked through the square, taking it all in, the sun began to set, painting the city in gold and amber.
"There's a traditional meyhane nearby that Omar has on his list of recommendations. Piraye Taş Plak. Apparently, they play classic Turkish records while you eat, and the food’s good."
"Sounds perfect," Aya agreed. "Amina?"
Amina, who had been photographing a wall of street art, nodded. "I could eat. Do they have alcohol? I could go for a drink."
“Indeed, they do,” Karim said. “Let’s go.”
The meyhane was warm, intimate, with walls covered in vintage travel posters and shelves laden with old records. A phonograph in the corner played traditional music, the crackling quality of the recording creating an atmosphere out of time.
They were seated at a corner table and presented with menus. Karim ordered a selection of mezze and a bottle of anise-flavored rakı, Turkey's national drink.
The bottle of rakı arrived, clear as spring water, with tall, narrow glasses alongside a pitcher of still water.
Karim filled their glasses and lifted his own first. “Birinci kadeh, first glass. To finding the truth before Aegis does.”
They clinked. Aya took a cautious sip, eyes watering. “Tastes like a black-licorice bonfire.” 
Karim laughed. “Come on, you’ve been to Turkey before.” He tapped the water pitcher.
“I’m not usually somewhere long enough to enjoy the culture.” She added water, and the liquid bloomed to a milky white. “Ah, science is magic.”
Amina raised her untreated glass of pure rakı. “Here’s to the woman who convinced thieves to play heroes! Try not to get us killed, Amrani.”
Karim banged the table. “Şerefe, cheers.”
More clinks, bigger swigs, and rounds of laughter.
Aya exhaled, cheeks flushing. “Why do people drink this voluntarily?”
Karim laughed. “We’re probably supposed to pace it. Mezze, water, conversation.”
“Well, too late for that,” Aya rasped, still smiling.
Servers covered the table in waves. Glossy eggplant smothered in garlic sauce. Midye dolma, mussels snapped open and stuffed with cinnamon-scented rice and pine nuts. Tender, raw çiğ köfte rolled in crisp lettuce. Grilled octopus drizzled with olive oil and lemon.
They devoured the feast in near silence until plates were cleared and a bottle of wine appeared.
"Oh, thank god. I'll switch to some wine, and you two can finish the rakı," Aya said, pouring a large glass. "Omar's contact should reach out tomorrow. Someone who's been tracking Çelebi's work for years. Until then—"
Her phone buzzed against the table. She glanced at the screen, then sat up straighter.
"Salah?" Karim asked.
Aya nodded, scanning the encrypted message. Her expression darkened.
"What is it?" Amina leaned forward.
"He intercepted new Aegis communications. They've confirmed a recovery team in Istanbul. At least six operatives currently, more soon." Aya scrolled further. "And they're not just looking for the Lens. They already know it was built in pieces. Multiple components, hidden separately. Çelebi scattered them after the Sultan destroyed his observatory."
Karim refilled his rakı glass. "So it's a race for fragments."
"A race we have to win." Aya set the phone face down. "Who knows what happens if they assemble even part of it..."
"They won't," Amina said, taking the rakı bottle from Karim's hand and topping off her own glass. "We got to the Amulet first. We'll get to this."
"Salah says one more thing." Aya's voice dropped. "They've got a lead we don't. Something about Çelebi's original workshop location. He's trying to intercept more, but—"
"But we're already behind," Amina finished.
Silence settled over the table. The phonograph crackled through a song change.
“I’m getting worried about his contacts. We need to move,” Aya said.
"Well then, may he hurry the hell up," Amina said finally, lifting her glass. "But for now, here's to the plan, whatever's left of it.”
The evening progressed with more food, more rakı, and more white wine. After three more rounds of drinks and two record changes, the album switched to Barış Manço’s deep voice. Aya felt a knot between her shoulders loosen.
Karim drummed his fingers on the table in sync with the bass line. “Feels good not to sprint for our lives.”
Amina leaned back, swirling her rakı. “A quick ceasefire with reality.” Her eyes locked on Aya, light but firm.
Aya lifted her glass in reply. “Then here’s to savoring the armistice. Tomorrow we’re back in the trenches. But for now, there’s nowhere I’d rather be.”
Amina locked eyes with Aya, flashing a wide grin that she couldn’t help but return. Aya looked away, then back, unable to break their eye contact before Karim placed his hand on her knee under the table.
It was nearly midnight when they finally left the meyhane, pleasantly full and slightly drunk. The streets of Kadıköy were still alive, but they opted to head back to the apartment, aware that the next day would be full and heavy.
They climbed the stairs to their floor, Karim fumbling with the keys, Amina still humming the last song from the phonograph. For a moment, standing in the dim hallway outside their door, Aya let herself enjoy the simple pleasure of the evening. Good food, good company, the promise of real work ahead.
Tomorrow, they would begin the search in earnest. But tonight belonged to rakı and laughter and the warmth of knowing they weren't facing this alone.
Chapter 2
Aya awoke before Karim, slipping from their bed without disturbing him. She found Amina already up, sitting cross-legged on the terrace, eyes closed in meditation.
Aya hesitated before joining her, not wanting to interrupt. She was turning to leave when Amina spoke without opening her eyes.
"Still creeping around like a cat, I see."
"Old habits," Aya replied, stepping onto the terrace. The morning air was crisp, light. "How long have you been up?"
"Couple of hours." Amina finally opened her eyes. "Couldn't sleep. I never can lately."
Amina rose to her feet in one fluid motion. "Coffee's made."
They moved to the kitchen, where Amina poured thick Turkish coffee into small cups. The rich aroma filled the space, momentarily displacing the tension of the previous night.
"You still take it black?" Amina asked.
"That’ll never change.” Aya accepted the cup.
Their fingers brushed during the exchange, and Aya felt Amina's eyes linger on her for a moment too long before she turned away.
Karim emerged from the bedroom, hair tousled from sleep. "Morning," he mumbled, making a beeline for the coffee. "Any disturbances?"
"All quiet," Amina reported.
"What's the plan for today?" he asked, accepting a cup from Amina with a grateful nod.
"First, breakfast at a café, watch the streets, see who’s tailing us," Aya said. "There’s no telling when Omar will get in touch with our contact here in Istanbul, so we need to be ready.”
"So, sip coffee while stressed about surveillance, ready to spring into action any time. That sounds relaxing," Amina added dryly.
Forty minutes later, they were seated at an outdoor table at Rafine, a sleek café with concrete floors, exposed brick walls, and artfully primitive wooden tables. The clientele was young and alternative, wearing ripped fishnets, chunky boots, and covered in tattoos.
"Easy to forget this is an ancient city," Karim said, looking around at the thoroughly modern scene.
"That's Istanbul," Aya said, breaking off a piece of her simit, a circular bread covered in sesame seeds. "Twenty-seven centuries of history mingling with hipster coffee shops, pubs, and tech startups."
She paused mid-bite. Across the street, partially obscured by a newspaper kiosk, stood a familiar hooded figure.
"Four o'clock," she said casually, not changing her relaxed demeanor. "Our friend is back."
Karim didn't turn, having learned his lesson. Instead, he picked up his phone as if to check messages, angling it to use the reflection in its dark screen. "Same as yesterday?"
"Can't tell from here," Aya said, taking a deliberate sip of her coffee. "But same build, same position. Just watching, not approaching."
Amina stretched languidly, using the motion to scan their surroundings. "One more possible. Behind us, blue jacket, pretending to read on his phone."
"What's our play?" Karim asked, panic creeping into his voice.
Aya considered their options. "Amina, when I stand up, I want you to head toward the market. Take the long way around. See if blue jacket follows. Karim, you pay the bill, then head back to the flat. I’ll approach our hooded friend."
"Isn’t splitting up usually how people get killed?" Karim asked.
"It's controlled," Aya replied. "We need to know who they're most interested in. And if it's all of us, we need to know how many operatives they have.”
Aya stood first, dropping her napkin deliberately, using the moment as she bent to retrieve it to scan their surroundings one final time.
"Ready?" she asked.
Amina nodded almost imperceptibly, then rose and headed south toward the Kadıköy fish market. As predicted, the man in the blue jacket pocketed his phone, waited twenty seconds, then followed.
Aya set a two-hundred lira note on the saucer, then whispered, “See you soon.” She strolled away while Karim waited for the card reader.
She crossed the street, keeping the kiosk between herself and the hooded man. The figure clocked her advance, turned, and slipped into a side lane. Aya followed at a brisk tourist’s pace—phone raised, snapping idle photos—until the lane spat her into the fish market’s roar of ice and gulls.
The hooded man drifted through the stalls, never faster than the crowd, always one vendor ahead. Aya mirrored the path, weaving past crates of sea bass, letting a tourist group create cover. When the man darted left toward a stack of Styrofoam boxes, Aya cut right, circling a row of shrimp tanks to intercept.
She arrived at the junction just in time to see the figure swing onto a fire escape and ascend, two rungs at a time.
Aya debated the chase, alone on unfamiliar terrain. She sprinted, boots clanging on steel, and popped onto the roof in time to glimpse the figure vault a gap and disappear down a stairwell three buildings away. 
Aya drew up short and caught her breath before her phone vibrated twice in rapid succession.
Karim: Inside. The apartment is still clear. You safe?
Amina: Lost tail near the ferry. Heading back now. Keep eyes up.
Aya sighed and typed a quick message: On my way. Rooftops gave me the slip. Then, she started the trek home.
Chapter 3
When Aya arrived back at the apartment, Karim was waiting, but they found no sign of Amina. Aya checked her phone. No new messages. The apartment appeared undisturbed, alarms still in place, security functioning.
"Should we be worried?" Karim asked, checking the time. "It's been almost an hour."
"Give her time," Aya said, though concern had begun to gnaw at her. "She knows how to handle herself."
"This isn't how I imagined my first proper day in Istanbul," Karim said.
"No guided tours of the Hagia Sophia?" Aya asked.
"Maybe later," he replied with a small smile. "After we figure out who's trying to kill us."
"They're not trying to kill us," Aya said. "Not yet, at least. They're assessing. Testing our capabilities. Monitoring."
"Is that supposed to be comforting?"
"Yeah. It means we have time."
Karim nodded, then went to retrieve his notebook from its hiding place. He spread his notes across the coffee table, focusing on the task at hand as a way to channel his nervous energy.
"I can’t just pace around waiting and stressing. I’m going to dive back in. If we assume Çelebi was working in this area during the Ottoman period," he said, "there must be records. The Ottomans were meticulous bureaucrats."
Aya joined him, grateful for the distraction, pushing concern for Amina temporarily aside. "Where would those records be kept now?"
"Most likely the Başbakanlık Ottoman Archives, on the European side. There might be local records here in Kadıköy, though, especially since Çelebi lived and worked in this area. That’s what I’m looking for.”
Aya pulled out her phone, and they got lost in a search for possible records rooms that could house the historical documents, if they still existed.
The sound of keys in the lock drew them both to their feet. Amina entered, looking disheveled but unharmed.
"Well, you're late," Aya said with a grin, trying to suppress the fear and relief in her voice.
"Had to make sure I wasn't followed," Amina replied, dropping onto the sofa. "Blue jacket was good. Really good. I thought I’d lost him when I sent the message, but then he appeared again. I managed to reverse it on him, though, and tailed him after he thought he lost me."
"Did you learn anything?" Karim asked.
She leaned forward. "Blue jacket met with someone else, a woman we haven’t seen before. Early-thirties, auburn hair chopped to the jaw, dressed more venture-capital than field operative. I didn’t see her face, but I could pick either of them out.”
Aya met her eyes, a silent understanding passing between them. It was familiar, that look, and for a moment, it was as if nothing had changed between them.
"That’s good,” Aya said. “For now, I suggest we separate and explore different areas. Make it harder for them to track all of us."
"Are you sure?" Karim questioned. "After what just happened?"
"Controlled separation," Aya said. "I'll walk the older parts of Kadıköy, look for historical buildings that would be the right age. Ask people if they’ve been seeing anything strange lately. Karim, check out some of the bookshops. You said Tellalzade has antique book dealers that we didn’t get to, right? See if you can find any local histories that mention astronomical studies during the Ottoman period. Who knows what the shopkeepers will say, who they may know. Who else may have been around asking questions."
"And me?" Amina asked.
"Take a break," Aya said softly. "You've been on high alert since Morocco. Walk the shoreline, look at the water, clear your head."
Amina looked like she might protest, but then nodded, understanding the tactical advantage of having one team member appear less engaged.
"Keep your phones on, check in regularly," Aya instructed. "And Amina—"
"I know," Amina interrupted. "Be careful. I've been doing this as long as you have, remember?"
"Longer, if I remember correctly," Aya said.
Amina rolled her eyes. “So, I’ll take my veteran rest, I suppose.”
"Meet back here at five," Aya said. "Hopefully, we have word from Omar by then about how to proceed. We need to get after this Astral Lens. I can’t believe it’s still radio silence; I’m getting worried something’s gone wrong."




After making her way down the steep street, the Moda shoreline stretched before Amina, the Bosphorus a glittering expanse of blue-green water dotted with ferries and container ships. She walked alone, a small paper cup in hand, taking occasional sips of the strong, over-sweetened Turkish coffee.
The boardwalk was busy with joggers, elderly couples walking arm in arm, and young people skateboarding, lounging on benches, staring at their phones, or out at the sea.
Amina found an empty bench overlooking the water and sat, allowing herself to enjoy the simple pleasure of sunlight on her face. It had been three weeks since Morocco. Three weeks of looking over her shoulder, waking from nightmares with the sensation of ancient power crawling beneath her skin, controlling her.
She rolled up her sleeve, examining the markings on her forearm. In the bright sunlight, they were barely visible, faded like an old tattoo, a ghostly reminder.
She traced one of the patterns with her finger, and for a brief, disorienting moment, felt a flutter of awareness that wasn't her own, an echo of the djinn's presence that had nearly consumed her in the Atlas Mountains.
"Still there, aren't you?" she whispered. "Just waiting. But what do you want with me?"
The sensation faded as quickly as it had come, leaving her alone again with the sounds of the sea and traffic.
And then there was Aya, playing on the back of her mind.
Seeing her again had been harder than Amina anticipated, and watching the intimacy she shared with Karim stirred emotions Amina had thought were safely buried beneath collapsed tombs and passing time. Desire she was used to, but jealousy was new. She always took what she wanted, even if it was off limits, but this was different.
For nearly two years, they'd been lovers and partners. Passionate, volatile, and ultimately unsustainable, as both pursued their separate agendas in their high-stakes world. Their relationship had ended abruptly after a job in Egypt went sideways. Amina had made it out on her own—she always did—but the betrayal had severed whatever bond they'd forged. They'd gone their separate ways.
Until Morocco forced them back together, their lives fully enmeshed for the foreseeable future, within reach but unable to touch.
Amina finished her coffee, crumpling the cup in her fist. Dwelling on the past wouldn't help their current situation. Aya had moved on. So would she. She had to. But a large part of her didn’t want to. That part wanted to make a move before it was too late.
But Amina knew she needed to be dialed in. She’d never been such a mess on a job before, and no job had ever felt as important. It was time to be herself again, which also happened to be the version Aya had fallen for. 
She stood, prepared to continue her walk, when something made her pause. A prickling sensation at the base of her skull. The awareness of being watched that had kept her alive countless times.
Casually, she bent to retie her boot, using the movement to scan her surroundings. The boardwalk remained filled with ordinary people going about their day. No one was paying particular attention to her.
Yet the feeling persisted.
Amina continued walking, maintaining an unhurried pace while remaining hyperaware of her environment. 
She took a deliberate wrong turn, doubling back along a different street to see if anyone altered their course to follow her. Nothing.
She was about to dismiss the feeling as paranoia when an old man coming from the opposite direction bumped into her shoulder as he passed, making them each stumble. As they did, he leaned close, his breath warm against her ear, stubble sharp against her cheek.
"Aegis is watching," he whispered. "Wizard Pub. Tonight. 8:00."
By the time she turned, he had disappeared into the crowd. They were no longer simply being watched.
Chapter 4
"Wizard Pub. Tonight. Eight." 
Amina's words hung in the air of their apartment like smoke.
Karim paced the living room, hands raking through his hair. "It's obviously a trap."
Aya pulled up Google Maps and studied the neighborhood around the bar, mentally mapping exit routes. "Maybe. But it's also the first direct lead we've had since we arrived."
"From a random old man who bumped into Amina on the street?" Karim's voice rose. "Who just happens to know about Aegis? And happens to know where we should go?"
"That's exactly why it feels legitimate," Amina countered, leaning against the wall. "If Aegis wanted to trap us, they wouldn't be this obvious. They've been tracking us since we arrived and could have grabbed us at any time."
Aya nodded. "They want information, not us. At least not yet. I think there’s a better chance this man is on our side."
Karim stopped pacing. "Or they're making it so obvious that we think exactly that, and we essentially turn ourselves over.”
"I don’t think so," Aya said. "This is a heavy metal bar, which tells me it’ll be far too loud for anyone tailing us to hear our conversation. That’s a good sign. Plus, we need to know who's contacting us and why. This man might know who has us under surveillance. Sitting here isn't giving us answers, and we still haven’t heard from Omar."
"We could scout it first," Amina suggested. "Check the place, see if there's anything suspicious before committing."
"Okay. Assuming we go," Karim said, "we need a signal. A way to communicate if things go sideways. And a rendezvous point other than this apartment." He ran his fingers along the spines of books on the shelf absently.
Amina pushed herself off the wall. "I'll go alone. Less risk that way."
"Absolutely not," Aya and Karim said together.
A ghost of a smile crossed Amina's face. "At least you two agree on something."
"We go together or not at all," Aya said firmly. “Too risky now.”
Karim checked his watch. "It's almost seven. If we're doing this, we need to decide."
The Bosphorus glittered through the windows as Istanbul’s lights began to illuminate the darkening sky.
"Well, I vote we go," Aya finally said. "But armed. And with a clear escape plan, like Karim said."
Amina nodded. "Agreed."
They both looked at Karim, who exhaled slowly. "Fine. But at the first sign of trouble—"
"We're gone," Aya finished. "No heroics."
Karim nodded. “I guess a metal bar in Kadıköy is less scary than a US military base in the remote Sahara.”
Thirty minutes later, they stood across the street from Wizard Pub. The bar's illuminated sign hung over the entrance, which was slightly below street level, where groups of black-clad patrons clustered, cigarettes glowing like fireflies in the darkness. Loud guitars and guttural screams poured straight onto the pavement.
"Perfect cover," Amina replied. "Loud music, dark interior.”
Aya scanned the street once more. "Remember the plan. One hour max, unless anything changes. We stick together. Anything goes wrong, we have our headings and regroup point."
“Check and check,” Karim said.
They crossed the street, the music growing louder as they approached. Inside, the pub was exactly as its exterior promised—dimly lit, brick walls lined with black band posters, the air thick with smoke and the scent of beer. Blue lighting cast a fantastical glow over the crowd of black t-shirts, jeans, and leather.
The main room was lined by small wooden tables and benches, each overflowing with groups downing pints of Efes, laughing and nodding their heads to the music. To their right, a long bar stretched along the wall, showcasing an impressive array of spirits and decorated with animal skulls and horns. 
Behind it stood a bartender with long hair and a beard, wearing a black shirt emblazoned with the phrase "Mors Certa, Hora Incerta.” Death is certain, but its hour is not.
"Where exactly are we supposed to meet this mysterious contact?" Karim asked, leaning close to be heard over the thundering bass.
"They didn't specify," Amina said. "I assume they'll find us." She looked them up and down. “Shouldn’t be difficult; you two stand out a bit. A sundress seemed appropriate for a metal bar?”
Aya shrugged. "I save my black tactical gear for more pressing times. Let's get drinks. Act natural."
They approached the bar, where the hulking bartender greeted them with a friendly smile. "Ne içmek istersiniz?"
"Üç bira, lütfen. Efes," Karim replied, holding up three fingers.
The bartender nodded, pouring three pints of the malt beer and sliding them across the counter. Karim paid in cash, and they found an empty table in the back along the wall, positioning themselves with clear views of both the entrance and the bar.
"Now what?" Karim asked after they'd settled.
"We wait," Aya said, taking a sip of her beer. "And watch. And enjoy ourselves."
They didn't have to wait long. Twenty minutes later, as Aya was about to get up for another round of drinks, a woman approached their table carrying four pints. She was striking. In her early thirties, with sharp features, elaborate eyeliner, and dark hair cut in a severe bob that framed her face. She wore a faded Turkish Iron Maiden t-shirt. A silver necklace with an unusual geometric pendant hung at her throat.
"Mind if I join you?" she asked in lightly accented English, not waiting for an answer before sliding onto the bench next to Karim and passing the beers around.
The three exchanged glances. Amina's hand disappeared beneath the table, likely reaching for her knife.
Aya spoke cautiously. "Thanks. Are you a fan of Moroccan carpets?"
The woman smiled. "Only if they're genuinely handwoven from outside Fez."
Aya’s posture relaxed. "Omar sent you?"
"Not directly," the woman said. "But yes, I'm your contact. My name is Leyla Yilmaz."
"How do you know Omar?" Karim asked.
“The trade, mainly through Abdelatif,” Leyla said. “But we first met in person after I got caught between customs officials and a shipment of Roman glass that ‘accidentally’ disappeared from the Ankara Museum’s restoration lab. Omar knew the right bribes, I knew the packing slips, and together we slipped the crates back into the museum storeroom before anyone filed a report. Since then, whenever antiquities go missing—or need to—he’s my first call.”
At the mention of Abdelatif, a somber silence had fallen over the table.
"And after what happened in Morocco," Leyla continued, lowering her voice, "this time, Omar reached out through a more secure channel."
"Why all the cloak and dagger?" Amina asked. "Why not just call us?"
Leyla leaned forward, her voice barely audible over the music. "Because Omar fears that there are eyes and ears on him at all times, and they’d easily be able to monitor any digital communication. That would extend to the three of you and any well-known associates. We have to be careful.”
Her fingers drummed on the table before continuing. "He passed word that they're watching his shop, his riad, monitoring his communications. Salah too. They’re being extremely cautious. He's trying to work around it with Salah's help, developing more secure methods of communication, but for now, he's using a network of contacts to relay messages."
"And you're one of these contacts?" Karim's skepticism was evident.
"I am. I’m the friend he told you about in Istanbul." Leyla took a folded piece of paper from her pocket and slid it across the table to Aya. "This should prove it. I received coded instructions from him two days ago, along with this."
Aya unfolded the paper to find a sketch of a familiar pattern. It was the same marking that had been on the Amulet of Idris in Morocco. Below it was a note in Omar's unmistakable handwriting: "The flower opens at midnight. Trust her. -O."
Aya nodded, passing the note to Karim and Amina. "Okay. We're listening."
Leyla smiled, revealing dimples on her cheeks. "Good. Because I've been researching Hazarfen Çelebi for years, and his alleged creation of the Astral Lens. It's said to be a device, like a cosmic magnifier, that’s designed to focus energy from specific planetary alignments into a controllable beam."
"We’ve heard the same about the Lens. What kind of alignments?" Karim asked, leaning forward.
"Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn forming a perfect triangle with the Pleiades as backdrop," Leyla replied. "The texts I’ve seen describe it as capable of harnessing extreme radioactive energy, pulling from deep space. Like a solar panel, but not limited to the sun and able to pull from the entire universe."
"And Aegis wants it because they’re hungry to control energy production," Aya concluded. "Yes, that aligns with everything we know so far."
"Apparently," Leyla said, “but Omar’s message and this chat are the first I’m hearing of this group, the Aegis.”
Karim leaned in. “Well, Aegis is a quasi‑corporate black‑ops outfit. They bankroll strategic digs to go after mythological powers, front as philanthropists, then weaponize whatever they can grab.”
“A month ago in Morocco,” Aya added, voice low, “they opened a djinn crypt in the Atlas to test an artifact called the Amulet of Idris. The power that was unleashed was devastating, and we barely stopped them. With it, they thought they could control global energy production.”
Leyla’s eyes widened. “So that chaos report in the Marrakech papers about wildfires, storms, collapsed buildings, that was you?”
“Mostly them,” Amina said, downing her second beer. “We just made sure it didn’t get worse.”
Leyla swallowed hard. “Understood. If Aegis is on Çelebi’s trail too, we’re on a clock. But, I doubt they have much. Everyone who has ever searched has hit dead ends, and mainstream academia has dismissed Çelebi's work as fantasy for centuries. My research suggests otherwise."
"Why would academia dismiss it?" Karim asked.
Leyla grimaced. "Because it challenges the established narrative that Ottoman science was derivative of earlier Greek works. My own theories about Çelebi's advanced astronomical knowledge and alchemical experiments weren't well-received, and they’re unprecedented without much evidence. He and his team kept things very secretive."
"So, you were ostracized after publishing your theories and turned to a quiet, simple life of working with Omar and his associates?" Amina asked.
"Professionally executed," Leyla laughed with a bitter smile. "Denied tenure, publications rejected, research funding cut. But I’ve continued my work independently."
"Okay. And what have you found?" Aya asked.
“Çelebi’s trail kept circling back to the Asian side of the city,” Leyla said, tapping the table for emphasis, “but I’ve been missing some key details—”
“My father’s work might be able to help if we combine notes,” Aya interjected. “He was an archaeologist at UC Berkeley. He spent time chasing Çelebi references, too, apparently. We found a lot of research in his notes.”
“Berkeley.” Leyla’s head snapped up. “Hassan Amrani was your father?”
“You knew him?”
“I traded letters with a Dr Amrani until his replies stopped years ago,” Leyla said softly. “Brilliant marginalia. Sketches, cipher notes. He got further than anyone in understanding how Çelebi’s lens systems actually worked.”
“Yeah. He’s no longer with us,” Aya said, voice steady but tight. “Whatever he sent you is all that’s left of that research, in addition to the notebooks we have.”
Leyla nodded. “I’m so sorry to hear that, but I had my suspicions. Those emails and letters are at my flat. You can have them. Together, we might uncover the missing coordinates I’ve been hunting.”
For the next hour, they had another round of drinks while Leyla outlined her research, explaining how Çelebi had likely collaborated with Taqi al-Din at his observatory before it was demolished in 1580. How he had combined astronomical knowledge with glassmaking techniques, potentially creating a lens that could focus cosmic energy.
"The problem," she explained, "is that the lens was dismantled after Sultan Murad III ordered the observatory destroyed. The story is that Çelebi hid the components and his notes throughout Istanbul, scattered for his followers to continue the work following his persecution. These stashes could be in Istanbul, or potentially beyond. There are rumors of secret societies, but no proof. From there, the story dies."
"And you think you can find these components?" Karim asked.
"With your help, hopefully. If your father's notes contained elements I've been missing, references to Kadıköy that align with patterns I've observed, there’s a great chance." She turned to Aya. "I've made progress, but we need to keep pushing, work together if we’re going to solve this before Aegis."
"Okay, sure," Amina said bluntly. “But you seem eager to throw yourself into a pretty massive fight. Beyond some academic curiosity, what skin do you have in the game?”
Leyla met her gaze directly and took a long breath before answering. 
"I… if you must know, my colleague, Emre, disappeared three months ago while following a lead about Çelebi's workshop. The last message I received from him mentioned being followed by a man in a hood. I knew it had to be them once I received Omar’s communication about people hunting Çelebi’s work." Her voice hardened. "I want to find the lens before they do because it’s my life’s work, and I want to find Emre or get revenge on his behalf. He’s one of my oldest friends."
Amina studied Leyla’s expression, unblinking. But something in Leyla’s tone, equal parts grief and grit, decided for Aya. They had an ally, intel, and a starting point. After weeks of static, the compass needle twitched.
Aya lifted her glass. “To new partners and old ghosts.”
They all clinked glasses, and the beer went down like a small victory.
Leyla set down her empty glass with a decisive clink. "You know what? We should celebrate properly. Hit another bar after this one? Maybe somewhere with dancing?”
Aya shook her head. "We should get back. Plan our next moves, review what we know—"
"The real work starts tomorrow," Amina cut in. "And once we begin digging, Aegis will be all over us. We'll be locked in like Morocco for the foreseeable future." She leaned back, arms crossed. "One night of celebration before the fight. And, I will note, I can still take anyone Aegis throws at me, even five beers in."
"We don't know this area," Aya pressed. "We don't know her." She gestured toward Leyla. "No offense."
"None taken," Leyla said with a slight smile.
Karim touched Aya's arm. "She's Omar's contact. And Amina's right, who knows what we're about to throw ourselves into. One night won't hurt."
Aya looked between the three of them, outnumbered. She sighed. "Fine. One hour. Then we're done."
"That's the spirit, you party animal," Amina said dryly.
Karim approached the bar to settle the tab, as Leyla scurried behind him and murmured to the bartender. Moments later, four shots of an herb‑laced rakı variant appeared, green and wicked. Aya and Amina stood and followed them to the bar.
“One for the road,” Leyla said, raising her glass high. “I know a place with actual dancing, not just head‑banging. Let’s celebrate the start of great things.”
“I could definitely blow off a little steam,” Amina said.
They downed their beers and herbal-tasting shots before leaving the pub, following Leyla into the cool night.
“It’s just around the corner,” Leyla called back.
When they turned, however, they hit a living wall of bodies. Every bar on the narrow lane had blown its seams wide open. Patrons swarmed the cobblestones shoulder‑to‑shoulder, drinks sloshing as they danced. A DJ crammed into an upstairs window blasted Anatolian psych‑funk that rattled drainpipes and set the crowd surging in waves. Bare bulbs strung between balconies lit the street with a warm glow.
Leyla shouted above the groove, “This happens sometimes when the bars spill over, late at night. The whole street becomes one venue.”
“We might survive this job after all,” Amina said with a laugh.
Karim twirled Aya under a canopy of lights and a swirl of bodies, laughter breaking free.
"Well, maybe this was a better idea than I expected," Aya said.
Leyla shouted again over the music. "I'm going to grab drinks from that bar!" She pointed toward a narrow doorway across the street, its interior dark compared to the pulsing lights outside. "Four beers?"
"Make mine a gin and tonic," Aya called back.
Leyla flashed a thumbs-up and disappeared into the crowd.
She pushed through the packed doorway into a cramped bar, the music muffled but still vibrating through the walls. The space was narrow, lined with mismatched stools and a sticky wooden counter. She scanned the room.
One man sat alone in the far corner, gripping a mug of tea. Late forties, frameless glasses, close-cropped blonde hair, and an expensive watch catching the low light. His posture was relaxed, but his eyes tracked her the moment she entered.
Leyla approached the bar and ordered three Efes, along with a gin and tonic, from the bartender. Then she drifted toward the corner table, stopping just close enough to speak without being overheard.
"I'm in," she said quietly, rearranging the contents of her purse and wallet, not looking at him. "They trust me."
Malik's voice remained pleasant, conversational even, the tone someone might use to discuss weekend plans. But his eyes were flat, empty of anything human. "Good. How much do they know?"
"They have Hassan Amrani's research. The daughter has his notebooks. Combined with what I have, we'll find the components."
"Then you'll accelerate the timeline." It wasn't a question. "I'll deploy additional operatives to apply pressure. Keep them moving, keep them afraid. Fear makes people careless and fast."
Leyla's jaw tightened. "And Emre?"
Malik took a slow sip of his tea. "Emre remains comfortable. Fed. Unharmed." His eyes finally met hers, cold and flat. "That continues only as long as you remain useful."
"I'm doing everything you asked."
"You're doing what's necessary." He set down his glass. "When the alignment approaches, you will take the components from them and deliver them to me. All of them. No hesitation, no warnings, no sudden attacks of conscience."
"I understand."
"Do you?" Malik leaned forward slightly. "Because I've seen your file, Dr. Yilmaz. You're clever. Resourceful. The kind of person who thinks they can find a third option." His voice dropped. "There is no third option. Deliver the components, and Emre lives. Fail me, and I will send him back to you in pieces before I come take the Astral Lens for myself. Are we clear?"
Leyla's hands trembled at her sides, but her voice stayed steady. "We're clear."
"Then go. Get them moving now, the alignment approaches. And remember, I'll be watching every step."
Leyla steadied her breath as she pushed through the crowd toward the street, carefully balancing the drinks.
By the time she emerged into the pulsing lights, her expression had reset to easy warmth. She raised the glasses overhead, weaving back to Aya, Amina, and Karim.



Back in the street, the other three danced until sweat beaded into the neckline of Aya’s dress, Karim swaying his hips to the rhythm, and Amina keeping pace while her gaze never left Aya. 
As the music shifted to a pulsing electronic beat, Amina appeared at Aya's side, a dangerous glint in her eye. "Remember Bulgaria?" she asked, voice low enough that only Aya could hear.
Aya did remember. The underground club, the heat, the dress Amina had worn, the way she’d styled her curly hair. The way they’d gone back to their hotel room and made love repeatedly into the early hours of the morning, before everything had fallen apart between them. 
Before she could respond, Amina had pulled her into the crowd, their bodies pressed into a familiar rhythm.
They moved together, Amina's hands light on Aya's hips, bodies grinding close enough that Aya could smell the familiar scent of her hair, could feel an old physical desire course through her, almost uncontrollably.
The atmosphere shifted, charged with memory and possibility.
Aya glanced over her shoulder to find Karim watching them, his expression unreadable in the dim light. She caught his eye, and he raised his glass slightly, either in encouragement, confusion, or resignation. The moment stretched between them, uncertain.
Amina leaned closer, her lips near Aya's ear. "He's not the jealous type, is he?"
"We haven't had reason to find out.”
Amina's laugh was soft and knowing. "Maybe not yet. But I feel like pushing that boundary."
Aya’s mouth opened, unsure how to respond, when Leyla appeared beside them, her face flushed from dancing. "This is amazing!" she shouted over the music. "I haven't done this in—"
She stopped mid-sentence, her expression freezing as she looked past them toward a darkened doorway across the street. Aya turned to follow her gaze.
There, half-hidden in shadow, stood a hooded figure. 
A camera flash from the crowd glinted off metal, a suppressed pistol held low in their left hand. The light caught features for a split-second, but not long enough to identify before the darkness swallowed them again.
"We need to go," Leyla yelled over the music, reappearing and setting the drinks on a table. "We’re putting all these people in danger.”
“Shit, the hunt’s begun early,” Aya said.
Chapter 5
"Sorry for the mess," Leyla said, clearing a stack of books from a worn leather couch. "I don't usually have visitors to my apartment."
The space defied the sleek minimalism of their own rented apartment. Instead, it resembled an archive that had collided with both an art studio and a library.
"Don't apologize," Aya said, already scanning the room with undisguised interest. "This is impressive."
The apartment occupied the top floor of a crumbling 19th-century building, with high ceilings and peeling paint. What it lacked in modern amenities, it made up for in character—and contents.
Every surface held artifacts of Leyla's obsessions. Shelves overflowed with leather-bound manuscripts and academic journals; walls disappeared beneath overlapping maps adorned with pins and handwritten notes; a massive desk near the window supported a computer surrounded by stacks of photocopied images and documents.
They’d fled the street party twenty minutes ago and seemingly evaded any tails back to Leyla’s, which had seemed safer than their exposed apartment.
"Is that what I think it is?" Karim asked, pointing to a framed document hung prominently on the wall.
Leyla smiled. "An original copy of Cihannüma. Seventeenth century, but it references Hazarfen's theories."
Karim approached it reverently. "I've only seen digital reproductions."
"The university library had it gathering dust in storage," Leyla said. "When they fired me, I liberated it."
"You stole it?" Amina asked. “Okay, Leyla, I like your style even more.”
"I prefer 'rescued.'" Leyla moved to a walnut table in the center of the room. "They didn't value it. I do." She began clearing the surface, stacking papers and books on the floor.
Aya noticed a collection of corkboards leaning against one wall, pinned with newspaper clippings, photographs, maps, diagrams, all annotated in Leyla's cramped handwriting.
"This is thorough," Aya said.
"You can say it. Obsessive," Leyla replied without looking up. "I've been tracking Çelebi for almost ten years now. The academic community calls it a waste of time. A conspiracy theory. They're wrong."
Once the table was cleared, Leyla disappeared into another room, returning with a cardboard tube. "After what happened tonight, I think we need to accelerate our timeline. Aegis knows you're here, of course, and now they know we've connected. That was to be expected, but not so soon.”
She extracted and unrolled a large sheet of heavy paper across the table, weighing the corners with small metal sculptures. It was a woodcut reproduction, yellowed with age, depicting a domed structure surrounded by smaller buildings.
"This," Leyla said with reverence, "is Taqi al-Din's observatory in Istanbul, constructed in 1577 and demolished just three years later."
The detailed illustration showed an elaborate complex, with astronomers working at various instruments under a massive dome.
"Wait," Karim said, leaning closer. "Is that...?" He pointed to a figure sketched in the corner, partially obscured but distinct in posture and dress.
Leyla's eyes lit up. "You see it? Most scholars miss it entirely."
"The clothing doesn't match the other astronomers," Karim observed. "And he's standing apart from the others, not quite part of the official group."
"Exactly." Leyla's voice quickened with excitement. "I believe that's Hazarfen Çelebi—not yet known by that name—working unofficially with Taqi al-Din. The historical record shows no connection between them, but this piece suggests otherwise."
"Why would his presence be hidden?" Aya asked.
"Because his theories were radical, borderline heretical for the time," Leyla replied. "Most considered him, even his presence, dangerous. And Taqi al-Din was the Sultan's official astronomer, bound by orthodox interpretations. For them to be collaborating, al-Din would have been risking execution, because Çelebi was exploring something different."
Amina, who had been circling the apartment examining Leyla's collection, rejoined them. "Different how?"
Leyla moved to a glass display case and returned with a cloth-wrapped bundle. She unwrapped it carefully, revealing several ceramic shards with distinctive patterns in deep crimson, cobalt, and turquoise.
"These fragments were fired in the imperial Iznik workshops," she explained. "I found them buried near the observatory site depicted in this woodcut."
Karim gently lifted one of the shards, examining its glossy surface. "I specialize in pottery. The under-glaze crimson is unmistakable. This is definitely Iznik work, late 16th century."
"But look at the pattern," Leyla urged. "It's not floral or calligraphic like traditional Iznik pottery."
The piece Karim held featured an intricate geometric design surrounding what appeared to be a stylized lens or eye.
"These aren't decorative pieces," Leyla continued. "I believe they're prototypes—experiments in creating what Çelebi called 'celestial glass,' a material that could capture and focus cosmic energy during specific star alignments."
"You're suggesting Çelebi was working with the imperial potters to create components for the Astral Lens?”
"Precisely." Leyla placed the fragments back in their cloth. "Çelebi wasn't just an astronomer or an inventor. He was blending disciplines in ways no one had attempted before, combining astronomy, alchemy, and material science. All of this pulled from his extensive travels and connections to other similar thinkers from his time, like your Idris."
Karim’s eyes took on a familiar, wide glint. "If you're right, this would redefine our understanding of 16th-century scientific development."
"It would," Leyla agreed. "It challenges too many established narratives about Ottoman science for it to be popularly considered."
She returned to the table and unrolled a second document. It was a faded map of Istanbul with the Bosphorus dividing its European and Asian sides.
"According to my research, Çelebi continued his work in secret after the observatory's destruction. He established workshops on both sides of the city." She pointed to several locations marked in red ink. "These are sites where I've found references or evidence of his presence."
Aya studied the map, noting that marks clustered around Kadıköy. "So he did work primarily in this area?"
"I believe so," Leyla said, nodding. "But I've hit dead ends repeatedly. Maybe with your father’s work, I can figure out what I’ve been missing."
Aya hesitated. Her father's notebooks had been her most closely guarded possession since his death, filled with his observations, theories, and personal reflections. She’d offered them in excitement, but sharing them meant exposing not only valuable research but intimate glimpses into the man who had shaped her life.
Meeting Leyla's eager gaze, she made her decision. There was no reason for half-measures now. "I have some of his work with me."
Aya removed her backpack and withdrew a leather-bound notebook, worn at the edges from years of handling. Her father's name was embossed on the cover: Dr. Hassan Amrani.
Leyla's eyes widened. "You brought it with you tonight?"
"I try not to travel without it. We feared someone may have gotten into our apartment," Aya said. She placed the notebook on the table, letting her hand linger on its cover before stepping back.
Leyla opened it reverently, turning pages filled with Hassan's neat handwriting, sketches, and equations. "This is incredible. His mind was extraordinary, as I remember."
"He dedicated his life to understanding the past," Aya said softly. "Sometimes at the expense of the present."
Amina placed a hand on Aya’s shoulder.
"There," Karim said suddenly, pointing to a page filled with what they had learned in Morocco were astronomical notations, and they all leaned in. "That's consistent with Ottoman star charts from the period Çelebi would have been working."
Leyla’s expression lit with recognition. "Yes! And look here—" She flipped forward several pages, finding a passage where Hassan had written about an "astral concentration device" theorized by an unnamed Ottoman scholar.
"He was tracking the same research paths," Leyla said. "But coming at it from the archaeological record rather than historical texts." Leyla blinked, then rubbed her temples with a laugh. “But we’re still half‑soaked in rakı. This is huge, I need to have my wits about me.”
She ducked into the kitchenette, set a slim copper cezve on the gas stovetop, and heaped in finely ground coffee and sugar. The room quickly filled with the syrup‑thick aroma of coffee as the brew foamed up the neck, and she poured it into squat porcelain cups.
“Liquid sobriety,” she declared, handing them around. 
“Right,” Leyla said, clapping once. “Let’s earn this caffeine.”
Pages fluttered, maps overlapped, pencils scratched. After minutes passed in silent absorption, Karim called everyone to his station.
“Look here,” he said. His finger traced a star chart Hassan had penciled in the margin. “Longitude matches Al‑Din’s meridian line, but the declination is off by four degrees. Why?”
“Precession?” Aya guessed.
Leyla shook her head, already thumbing through her printouts. “No, Hazarfen corrected for that. Wait—” She slid a vellum overlay on top of the chart. The misaligned star now rested in the dead center of a sketched lens. “He wasn’t mapping the sky; he was choosing a focal star.”
Amina whistled, low and impressed.
Minutes later, Karim angled a pottery shard under the desk lamp. “Same eight‑point star that’s in the notebook. Hassan drew it, Çelebi fired it, and you found it in the rubble.”
“Triangulation confirmed,” Leyla said.
They began constructing a rough timeline on scrap paper: observatory demolished, secret workshops open, fragments dispersed. 
Coffee cooled, forgotten on the table. By the time the morning call to prayer drifted in through peeling window frames, the map of Kadıköy was a constellation of red circles, and a plan was finally tangible.
"Wait," Karim said, flipping back through Hassan's notebook with renewed focus. "Your father referenced specific components throughout his notes, but never in one place. Let me see if I can reconstruct the list."
He grabbed a blank sheet of paper and began writing as he cross-referenced Hassan's sketches with Leyla's research. "Hassan mentions a glass fragment, something he calls the 'primary lens element.' A hollow cylinder, possibly for channeling energy. Then there are references to calibration rings. He sketches two of them, inner and outer."
Leyla leaned over his shoulder, excitement building. "Yes! And my research mentions a focusing array with multiple glass elements working in concert. Plus, what the texts call a 'crystal heart,' probably the central focusing element."
"There's more," Karim continued, his finger tracing a particularly dense page of calculations. "Hassan was obsessed with something he called the crown lens. He writes that it's not just a component but the control mechanism for the entire system. And here—" He tapped a margin note. "He references a 'stabilization wafer' that appears in Çelebi's original designs."
"So we're looking for at least seven major components," Aya said, studying the list Karim had written.
"Eight, technically," Leyla corrected. "The glass fragment, the cylinder, inner and outer calibration rings, focusing array, crystal heart, crown lens, and the stabilization wafer—though that last one might be purely theoretical since it sounds critical and we’re pretty sure this thing has never been used."
Amina whistled low. "That's one hell of a scavenger hunt."
"It's not just about finding them," Karim said, his expression growing serious as he read more of Hassan's notes. "Look at this. He references two operating regimes: stable and unstable. With all components properly assembled, including the crown lens and the wafer, the system can operate in a controlled manner. But with a partial array it can still hypothetically work..." He paused, reading the cramped handwriting. "But he calls it 'catastrophically chaotic.'"
"Meaning what, exactly?" Amina asked.
"Meaning if someone tries to activate this thing without all the pieces," Karim said, "the results could be worse than the complete Astral Lens falling into the wrong hands."
"So, it's clear they were building this cosmic magnifier, and making great progress," Karim continued, setting the list aside. "Using specific materials to focus energy from celestial alignments."
"But for what purpose?" Amina asked from her perch on a windowsill, where she sat beside a pile of historical maps of the area, smoking a cigarette out the window.
"Power," Leyla answered. "The kind of power that doesn't require fuel or conventional energy sources. Imagine harnessing cosmic radiation through a precisely crafted lens during specific astronomical events."
"Like a solar panel, but for cosmic energy. Like radiation?" Aya asked.
"More profound than that," Leyla said. "The texts suggest it could affect the fundamental forces that bind reality. Gravity, time, perhaps more."
Amina stood, putting out her cigarette while her other hand unconsciously moved to the faded marks on her arm. "Like the Amulet."
A heavy silence fell over the room. The Amulet of Idris had opened a doorway to forces beyond their understanding, forces that had nearly consumed them all.
"So they’re still playing the same game. If Aegis gets hold of the Astral Lens," Aya said slowly, "they could replicate what they wanted to try in the Atlas Mountains. Or worse."
"Then we find it first, or we stop them. Again," Karim stated firmly. “That’s why we’re here.”
Amina shook her head. "But in Morocco, we knew exactly where the Amulet was, and they still beat us to it. We got lucky, playing off Léglise’s megalomania, knowing he’d make mistakes. We might not be so lucky. Here, we have theories and fragments, but no clear location. We’re flying blind."
Leyla spread out another map, this one more detailed, showing Kadıköy's streets and landmarks. "Well, here’s the best lead from everything we’ve put together. Based on our combined research, I believe Çelebi established a workshop somewhere in this area." She circled a section of the map encompassing several blocks of the oldest part of Kadıköy.
"That's dozens of buildings," Aya observed. "We can't search them all without attracting attention."
"We won't have to," Karim said, excitement building in his voice. "Look at your father's notations about architectural markers. They’re specific symbols Çelebi incorporated into buildings where he worked. A lot of them may still be intact. Like we said earlier, Istanbul’s a patchwork of East meets West, old meets new. I bet most of this architecture has been preserved."
He turned to a page in Hassan's notebook where several symbols were sketched: a crescent intersected by a straight line; a star with eight uneven points; a circle containing what appeared to be waves.
"If we can identify these markers on buildings in the area Leyla indicated, we can narrow our search," Karim continued. “They’ll be hidden as design elements.”
"So this is a way of marking sites connected to Çelebi's work, his followers, and their organization. A way for the underworld to communicate in plain sight,” Amina said. “Not bad, Çelebi.”
Aya felt a familiar mix of pride in her father’s work and the weight of his absence. "So we develop a search grid,” she said. “Map these symbols throughout old Kadıköy."
"Starting here," Leyla agreed, marking several points on the map. "These buildings date to the right period. If they contain these markers, we'll have our first solid leads."
As they devised their search plan, Karim continued paging through Hassan's notebook, comparing notes with Leyla's research.
"Wait," he said suddenly, his voice sharp with discovery. "Sorry to do this again, but look at this."
He pointed to a small symbol Hassan had drawn repeatedly in the margins of several pages, a simple design resembling an eye with rays emanating from it.
"I've seen this before," Leyla said, frowning. "But I can't place where."
"It appears whenever he mentions Kadıköy specifically," Karim noted. "Almost like a location marker."
“That’s a cartographer’s mark, an old one. Like an artist’s signature.” Leyla rifled through a stack of documents on a nearby shelf, extracting a yellowed sheet protected in a plastic sleeve. "Here!"
It was a centuries-old map of Kadıköy, the paper brittle with age. Near the coastline, barely visible unless you knew to look for it, was the same eye symbol.
"What's at that location now?" Aya asked, leaning closer.
Leyla overlaid the antique map with her modern one, aligning landmarks that had survived centuries of urban development. The symbol is aligned to an area near the historic Karacaahmet Cemetery.
"One of the oldest Ottoman burial grounds in the city," Leyla whispered. "Dating back to the 16th century."
"Çelebi's time.”
"But couldn’t this cartographer’s signature appear in a ton of places on different maps from the time? I’m sure he made more than one. And why would he mark a cemetery?" Amina asked.
“Impossible to know,” Leyla said. “This is the only map I’ve seen bearing this cartographer’s symbol. And he did work with Taqi al-Din, so he would have interacted with Çelebi, if we’re all right.”
Aya's mind raced through possibilities. "So this cartographer could be communicating a hidden location, like the architectural symbols, for the members of the secret society within the Ottoman court. Maybe a hidden workshop? Secret meeting place? Or—"
"His own burial site in the cemetery," Leyla finished. "What better place to hide crucial information than on a tombstone? Hidden in plain sight for centuries, always protected from demolition, destruction."
The four exchanged glances, implications settling over them like dust.
"We need to go there," Aya said. "Now."
"Not so fast," Amina cautioned. "If your father identified this location, Aegis easily could have too. They’re always one step ahead of us. We need to be careful."
"Agreed," Leyla said, reaching for her jacket. "But we also need to hurry; they know we're making progress."
As they gathered their materials, preparing to leave, Aya held Hassan's notebook up to the window, examining the eye symbol under better light.
"This is odd," she murmured. "There's something here I didn't notice before."
The others gathered around her as she tilted the notebook, revealing faint indentations on the page—impressions left when Hassan had pressed too hard while writing on another page, sitting atop the notebook.
"It looks like..." Aya squinted. "Arabic numerals? A date."
"Can you make it out?" Karim asked.
"1580," Aya said slowly. "That’s the year the observatory was destroyed."
"And underneath?" Leyla prompted, seeing more indentations.
Aya's expression changed from concentration to shock. "A name. Not Çelebi, but... well, I’m not sure what this inscription is." She looked up at the others, her voice dropping. "Ayn-ı Semavi."
"The Eye of the Heavens," Leyla translated.
"Or, the Astral Lens," Amina breathed.
Chapter 6
The morning mist still clung to the cypress trees of Karacaahmet Cemetery as they met up outside the entrance, approaching in near unison after a lengthy counter-surveillance route.
The streets around the cemetery were already crowded with groups gathering on corners beneath banners. 
"Labor protests today," Leyla said, noting Aya's curious look. "The unions have been organizing for weeks. Wage disputes, pension reforms. Half the city will be shut down by afternoon."
"Will that be a problem?" Karim asked.
"Depends," Amina said, watching the growing crowds. "Could give us cover. Or complicate things if it turns ugly."
"It usually does," Leyla said quietly. "But the cemetery should be far enough from the main routes. We'll be fine."
"The oldest section is over here," Karim said, leading them deeper into the cemetery. His boots thudded along a clay path where fallen needles muffled every step. "The layout hasn't changed much since the sixteenth century. If Çelebi left markers here, they'd be among these stones."
The cemetery sprawled across Üsküdar’s slopes. Marble headstones rose on either side between the dense cypress trunks. Some were crowned with stone turbans, or Sufi felt caps, others chiseled with tulip reliefs that marked women’s graves.
Karim knelt beside one of the older stones, running his fingers over the carved text. "The calligraphy is exquisite. Look at these letter forms. And, we’re right, sixteenth-century." He glanced up at Aya. "Well, these are definitely from Çelebi's era. Let’s look for any of these architectural symbols. Maybe the cartographer’s signature. Anything that could hint at Çelebi and his followers."
They spread out among the graves, each taking a different row. Aya found herself drawn to a section where the stones looked older, more weathered. She photographed each one methodically to reference the inscriptions later.
"Found something," Amina called from several rows over.
They converged on her position. She stood before a modest gravestone, less ornate than its neighbors. Where other stones bore elaborate calligraphy describing the deceased's virtues and lineage, this one had simpler text and something more.
"Look at the base," Amina said, kneeling to brush away accumulated dirt and moss.
As she cleared the stone's foundation, symbols emerged. Not the typical Islamic calligraphy, but patterns.
"It's the same as in our notes," Aya whispered. "The crescent intersected by a straight line. And here—" she pointed to a series of marks that looked almost like scratches until you knew what to look for, "—these are numbers."
Leyla crouched beside them, her excitement palpable. "Could they be more coordinates?"
Aya was already pulling out her phone, opening an astronomy app she’d downloaded when she and Karim had been poring over Hassan’s coordinates in Marrakech. "Read them to me."
Leyla quickly translated. "Right ascension: 4 hours, 35 minutes. Declination: positive 16 degrees, 30 minutes."
Aya input the coordinates, then looked up with a wide smile. "Aldebaran. The eye of Taurus. It would have been visible from Istanbul during the winter of 1580. That’s the year the observatory was destroyed.”
"Çelebi or his followers were marking graves to signal to others in secret," Leyla said. "Were they creating a star map? Why? And why hide it here?"
They documented the stone carefully with photographs from every angle, careful notes on its position, and inscriptions. As they worked, the sun climbed higher, burning away the morning mist. 
Other visitors began arriving at the cemetery, forcing them to work more discreetly.
Over the next two hours, they located four more graves with similar markings. Each bore coordinates for different stars: Regulus in Leo, Spica in Virgo, Antares in Scorpius, and Fomalhaut in Piscis Austrinus.
"These are all first-magnitude stars," Karim read from his phone as they compared notes. "The brightest in their constellations. And all would have been visible from Istanbul at different times of the year."
"There's a pattern forming," Leyla said, spreading their hand-drawn map on a flat tombstone. She had been plotting each marked grave's position within the cemetery, adding an ‘X’ to the grid. "Look at the arrangement."
As she connected the dots between the marked graves, a familiar shape emerged.
"It could be an eight-pointed star," Aya said. "Just like the symbol on the pottery fragments."
"And in your father's sketches," Karim added.
"So we’ve found five graves," Amina said. "Well, I think we can all count. So, if we’re right, that means there should be—"
Leyla laughed. "Yeah, we need to find three more."
They expanded their search, but as the morning wore on, frustration began to set in.
“If these graves make a star pattern, we can’t have missed them. One should be right here, exactly where I’m standing. Maybe they never finished the pattern, or they got interrupted,” Amina called.
"Wait," Aya said suddenly, stopping dead in her tracks. She stared at their rudimentary map. "We're wrong. The graves are in a pattern, but not the one we think."
"What do you mean?" Amina asked, jogging over and peering over her shoulder.
Aya took out her father’s notebook and tapped it excitedly. "These aren't just random stars. Look at how my father sketched them in relation to each other—he wasn't mapping the stars as they appear in the sky." She flipped through pages quickly, finding a specific diagram. "He was mapping how they'd appear if projected onto the cemetery itself. The cemetery is the canvas!"
Karim's eyes lit up. "Of course! The gravestones aren't just marked with star coordinates. They're physically arranged to mirror the astronomical positions."
"Exactly," Aya said. "The cemetery layout itself is a star map."
Leyla grabbed the notebook, studying the diagram, then pulled out a compass from her pocket. "If we use these five graves as known points in an eight-pointed star pattern..."
"We can triangulate the exact positions of the missing three," Karim finished, already calculating angles on his phone.
"That’s damn impressive," Amina whispered. "How to hide something in plain sight for centuries."
Karim looked up from his calculations. "I have coordinates for the missing points. They should be approximately fifty meters northwest of here, thirty-five meters east, and—" he pointed toward a cluster of cypress trees, "—just beyond those trees."
"Let's go," Aya said, heart racing. 
The morning heat intensified as they followed Karim's calculations to the first projected point. As they walked, she kept an eye over her shoulder, monitoring the other visitors to the cemetery, waiting for any sign of trouble.
Sweat beaded on Aya's forehead as she pushed aside overgrown grass around a weathered tombstone. "Nothing here," she sighed, brushing dirt from her hands.
"The stone could have been moved," Leyla said, scanning the surrounding area. "Or destroyed during renovations."
Amina, perched on a nearby grave marker, shook her head. "Or we're completely wrong again."
"Let's check the second point," Aya insisted.
The second location proved equally disappointing, revealing a section of newer graves, clearly from the wrong century. Frustration settled over the group like the thickening humidity.
"This doesn't make sense," Karim said, rechecking his calculations. "The pattern is precise. These points should complete the star chart."
They trudged toward the third location, following a narrow path between densely packed graves. The cypress trees created a tunnel of shadow and light, their footsteps crunching on fallen needles.
"Maybe we need to reevaluate—" Leyla began, then stopped abruptly. "Wait. What's that?"
Ahead, partially hidden by overgrown shrubs, sat a simple marble bench. Its weathered surface blended so perfectly with the surrounding stones that they might have walked past it entirely.
"That would be just a bench," Amina said, disappointment evident.
"No," Aya gasped, already moving forward. She knelt beside it, eyes scanning the marble surface. "Look at the base."
There, almost invisible beneath centuries of grime, was the familiar eight-pointed star symbol etched into the stone.
"This is it," Karim said, dropping to his knees beside Aya. His shoulder pressed against hers as they both leaned in to examine the carving.
Their fingers brushed as they traced the symbol, and they exchanged an exhilarated smile, the thrill of discovery momentarily eclipsing everything else.
"Help me move it," Aya said, already pushing against the bench.
The marble groaned against the earth as all four strained against its weight. Slowly, the bench shifted, revealing what lay beneath: a flat circular stone with a depression in its center, like a shallow bowl carved into the earth.
"It's not a grave marker," Leyla said, stepping back. "It's something else entirely."
"Look at these," Leyla said, pointing to tiny symbols carved around the rim of the depression. "More notations. And here—" she indicated a series of marks that looked like rays emanating from the center, "—is this a light path? Or energy flow?"
Aya’s fingers found a nearly invisible seam around the edge of the stone. "It's not solid. There's a gap here."
She pressed her fingertips into the narrow crack and pulled upward. The stone didn't budge.
"Let me," Amina said, producing a compact crowbar from her backpack. She wedged it into the seam and applied careful pressure.
A soft scraping sound emerged as the circular stone lifted slightly. Working together, they eased it up and away, revealing a hollow space beneath.
Inside the cavity sat a metal box, roughly the size of a large book. Its copper surface had oxidized to a mottled green, but the elaborate filigree work remained intact, depicting swirling, elongated orbital patterns.
"Impressive metalwork," Leyla whispered, her voice thick with reverence. “At first glance, the age seems correct.”
The box was sealed with dark wax that bore a familiar impression: the eye symbol from Hassan's notebook. Aya reached for it with trembling hands, lifting it carefully from its hiding place.
"So, it's been here for over four hundred years," she said. "Waiting."
The wax seal cracked with a sound like breaking ice as Aya carefully pried it open. Inside, wrapped in what appeared to be oilcloth treated with beeswax, lay a tightly rolled document. The ancient fabric crackled beneath her touch as she gently unfolded it.
The ink had faded to a rich sepia. Diagrams covered the parchment—furnaces, workbenches, and unknown instruments, all rendered with detailed precision.
As they huddled over the fragile paper, a distant sound filtered through the cemetery's quiet. Voices raised in unison, the rhythmic chanting faint but unmistakable.
"Do you hear that?" Amina asked, lifting her head.
Aya nodded, but didn't look up. "Probably a tour group."
They carefully photographed each section of the plans with their phones, while the chanting grew gradually louder, more distinct.
Karim frowned. "That doesn't sound like tourists."
A single police siren wailed in the distance, then another. Leyla straightened, her expression concerned. "Okay, you’re right. We need to hurry," she said. 
"Well, these are plans for a workshop, a laboratory," Karim said, leaning in to study the plans. "Look at the equipment. Glass furnaces, grinding wheels, polishing stations."
"I can’t believe it. Not just any lab," Leyla said. "The lens-making facility. See these specifications along the margins? They're describing different types of glass. Crystal, flint, even what looks like early optical crown glass."
"Some of these materials shouldn't have existed in the sixteenth century," Karim noted. "The chemical formulations, they're incredibly advanced."
Amina pointed to notations in one corner. "These look like instructions for combining materials. Creating specialized glass with specific properties."
"For focusing cosmic energy," Aya said quietly. "This is how Çelebi and his followers made the Astral Lens, if he was successful."
Karim traced the star pattern on the plans. "Look at this notation in the margin. It references the eight-pointed star we found in the cemetery graves. I think the burial locations aren't just symbolic; they're marking the cache sites where Çelebi hid the components. Each grave corresponds to one piece of the lens."
"So the cemetery isn't just a clue," Leyla said, eyes wide. "It's a map to eight specific locations throughout the city."
Karim nodded. “Or far beyond Istanbul, potentially.”
As they studied the document, the sound of sirens and chants grew louder, eroding their concentration.
"That's a lot of police, and a lot of people coming our way," Amina said, looking up from the plans. “Neither’s my favorite type of company.”
"We should go if they’re coming this way," Aya said, carefully rolling up the document. "Too much attention."
They quickly replaced the stone lid, stored their discovery in Karim’s bag, moved the bench back into position, and made their way toward the cemetery entrance while the sounds of disturbance grew louder.
Through the gates, they could see crowds gathering in the streets. People were streaming in from all directions, signs and banners held high overhead. Police vehicles were arriving in force, officers in riot gear beginning to form lines.
"What are they protesting?" Karim asked.
“Something about wages,” Leyla said. “Sorry, I’ve been checked out of the news ever since Emre disappeared. I’ve been absorbed in my work.”
"Well, I don’t think we’ll have time to find out," Amina replied with a tilt of her head. "Look."
There was a figure standing across the street from the cemetery entrance. Even among the growing crowd, the dark hood was unmistakable.
Chapter 7
"Shit. We've been made," Aya yelled.
More hooded figures were becoming visible, clearly not part of the protest, positioning themselves at strategic points around the cemetery entrance.
"We need to blend with the crowd," Aya continued. "Use their numbers to our advantage."
They stepped out of the cemetery gates just as the first wave of protesters surged past on the street. As they merged with the flow of bodies, the hooded figures moved to follow, but the density of the crowd made tracking difficult. Aya led them through the thickest parts of the protest. Bodies jostled in every direction, signs were raised overhead, and chants Aya couldn’t understand echoed around them.
Then, suddenly, a massive line of riot police blocked their path, shields locked together as protesters pressed forward.
"This way," Leyla called, pulling them out of the crowd. She moved with practiced efficiency, checking sight lines before committing to the side street, then led them in a zigzag pattern that kept them out of direct view from the main thoroughfare. "Stay low, single file," she added.
Aya followed Leyla’s lead, studying her closely, used to taking on the role herself.
Free from the tangle of bodies, they broke into a run, Leyla setting a pace that suggested she'd done this before. But, as they turned the corner, they found themselves face to face with three more hooded figures walking calmly in their direction.
The tallest of the three stepped forward, lowering his hood to reveal the face of a man in his forties, with close-cropped blonde hair and sharp, calculating eyes behind frameless glasses.
"Ms. Amrani," he said, his voice cutting through the chaos behind them. "My name is Malik. We need to talk."
Aya shifted her weight, ready to move. "I don't think we have anything to discuss."
Malik's smile didn't reach his eyes. "I think we do. About your father's research. About Çelebi. About what you just found in that cemetery."
The other two figures flanked him, their faces still obscured by their hoods. One was shorter, stockier, with gloved hands clenched into fists. The other was tall and wiry.
"How do you know anything about my father?" Aya demanded, buying time as she assessed their options. The alley behind Malik was too narrow for an escape, and the protest behind them was becoming more volatile by the second.
"Hassan Amrani was a brilliant archaeologist," Malik said, his tone calm, almost reverent. "We worked together for years on Ottoman astronomical innovations. I learned more from him than from any university, any intelligence service, any organization that's employed me since."
Amina edged closer to Aya, her voice barely audible. "Three meters to your left. Small alleyway. Fire escapes to the roofs."
Aya didn't acknowledge her, instead keeping her eyes fixed on Malik. "Funny, he never mentioned you or Aegis."
"Hassan kept many things to himself, I’m sure," Malik replied calmly. "He always had secrets from me, no matter how closely we worked together. Including what he discovered about the Astral Lens. Including why he chose to abandon our research and disappear. Including the real reason he was in Colombia when he died."
Five more of the hooded figures they'd seen flanking the protest had suddenly converged behind Malik. He acknowledged them with a nod.
Distant voices rose in anger, the chanting becoming more aggressive. Back on the main street, the protest surged against the police line, who took to banging their batons against their shields in warning.
"I'm not here representing Aegis corporate interests," Malik continued, his voice steady despite the chaos building around them. "I'm here because you're continuing Hassan's work, and you have a right to understand what he discovered. What frightened him enough to hide it. What he died protecting." He paused, meeting Aya's eyes directly. "And what humanity desperately needs, whether it frightens us or not."
"You mean like the cooperation you forced from Leyla's colleague?" Amina cut in, her hand hovering near her concealed knife.
A flicker of surprise crossed Malik's face before his composure returned. "Emre made his choice; we did not make it for him."
"You know where he is, then?" Leyla demanded, stepping forward.
"Safe," Malik replied smoothly. "And he will remain that way, depending on how this conversation ends. We are not killers, unless our hand is forced."
The shorter hooded figure took a step toward them, hand sliding beneath their jacket. Aya caught a glimpse of metal.
A sudden crash echoed behind them as protesters broke through a police barricade. Shouts and screams erupted, followed by a series of distinctive pops as tear gas canisters were fired.
"Last chance," Malik said, and his voice carried disappointment rather than threat. "I'm asking you to trust what Hassan would have wanted if he'd lived long enough to see the crisis we're facing. Climate collapse, resource depletion, civilizational stagnation. Conventional solutions aren't working fast enough. The lens represents a fundamental shift in human capability—not just power, but transformation. The kind of evolutionary leap our species needs to survive."
"The plans stay with us," Aya said firmly. They were outnumbered, outgunned, with their backs to a growing riot. But chaos could be an ally if used correctly.
Malik sighed. "Hassan made the same choice, choosing safety over progress, fear over courage. I respected him too much to force his hand then. But I can't extend that same courtesy indefinitely when the stakes are this high." He nodded to his companions, who began to advance.
The acrid scent of tear gas reached them just as the first canister bounced into the side street, trailing white smoke. Behind it, a surge of panicked protesters poured around the corner, fleeing the gas.
"Now!" Aya shouted, seizing the moment.
She grabbed Karim's arm and pulled him toward the narrow gap between buildings that Amina had spotted earlier. Amina and Leyla followed instantly, disappearing into the crush of bodies as protesters flooded the area.
A hand grabbed at Aya's jacket, but she twisted free, ducking low and pushing through the crowd.
Malik shouted, but his words were lost in the chaos. 
The tear gas burned Aya’s eyes, blurring her vision as she pulled Karim through the narrow passage. Behind them, she heard Amina's sharp command—"Left! Go left!"—directing Leyla through the maze of alleyways.
They emerged onto another street filled with fleeing protesters. Aya's lungs burned, her eyes squinting and streaming. Through the bloodshot haze, she spotted Amina pulling Leyla out of the side street.
"This way!" Karim shouted, pointing toward a covered bazaar where merchants were hurriedly closing their stalls.
As they reached the bazaar entrance, Aya chanced a look back. Through the thinning crowd, she glimpsed Malik standing perfectly still amid the chaos, watching them with an expression that wasn't anger or frustration but something closer to regret. Even at a distance, she could feel the weight of his gaze, not threatening but evaluating, as if he’d seen it all before, was only going through the motions.
Then they were inside the bazaar, weaving through narrow aisles between shuttered shops, the sounds of the riot diminishing behind them.
"Keep moving," Aya gasped, wiping her eyes. "They'll be tracking us."
As they navigated the narrow bazaar aisles, Leyla instinctively avoided the sight lines from the entrance, chose a path that kept them behind vendor stalls, and somehow knew exactly which passages connected to different exits. "Cameras are mounted every forty meters in these older bazaars," Leyla called, pointing them toward a blind spot. "Standard municipal surveillance grid."
How does a fired academic know Istanbul's surveillance infrastructure? Aya wondered, but there was no time to ask.
"Did we lose them?" Leyla asked, her voice ragged.
"For now," Amina yelled, glancing back at the entrance. "But they know what we have, and they know where we’re staying."
They eventually emerged onto a quieter street several blocks from the protest and finally slowed to catch their breath.
"So, that was Aegis in Turkey," Karim said.
"And they know exactly who we are and what we were up to. Probably always have," Aya added. "And Malik was back focusing on my father’s work."
"He's the one who's been following us since we arrived," Amina said. "Bastard."
Leyla leaned against the wall of the brick building, her face pale. "And they do have Emre."
Aya checked her bag, making sure the document was still secure. They had the architectural plans. They had Malik’s name. And they had confirmation that Aegis was actively hunting them, but stopping short of actually harming them, for now.
But as they caught their breath on that quiet Istanbul street, Aya couldn't shake the feeling that they were still missing something crucial. Something her father had known, something she increasingly suspected may have cost him his life.
Something that Malik desperately wanted to find.
Chapter 8
Tear gas still burned in their lungs and eyes as they walked toward the Bosphorus.
"Everyone accounted for?" Aya managed between deep breaths.
"Yeah," Amina panted, wiping streaming eyes with her sleeve. Her typically infuriatingly composed appearance was now disheveled, her dark hair streaming wildly.
Karim leaned against a shuttered storefront, chest heaving. "Well, that escalated quickly."
"Too quickly," Leyla agreed, checking over her shoulder. "Do you think Aegis orchestrated that, and then it got out of hand? Such a random place and time for a protest.”
“How the hell are we supposed to know? Anything’s possible with these guys,” Amina said.
“But it seems they’re afraid to move against us in public for some reason. They just linger, watching and waiting for an opportunity. Menacing but never attacking. We need to not give them any more,” Aya said. “I don’t think they’ll open fire in public. One round on camera and every counter‑terror statute slams shut. Their cultural‑consultancy cover dies on the evening news.”
"And we need to look at that final inscription," Karim said. "The one we photographed before everything went sideways."
Aya brought up the image on her phone. Even through the screen's glare, the elaborate Ottoman calligraphy from the last gravestone they'd documented was impressively intricate. Centuries of weather had softened its edges but hadn't erased its message.
"It’s in Turkish. Leyla?" she prompted, holding out the phone.
Leyla squinted at the screen, tilting it from the light, as her lips moved silently while she worked through the archaic text.
"It's definitely a reference to 'Ayn-ı Semavi,'" she muttered. "And here—" her finger traced a grouping of characters "—this word. 'Mercek.' It means lens."
Karim clapped his hands. "First concrete textual evidence we've found. That’s something, right?"
Amina glanced nervously behind them as a wave of fleeing protesters rushed past. "I, for one, am not ready to celebrate, mister positive. Can we discuss ancient Turkish somewhere that doesn't carry a threat of tear gas or prison?"
"It is affirming, but she's right," Aya said. "We can't stay exposed like this. And moving as a group makes us more visible and easier to track."
A police helicopter thundered overhead, its searchlight sweeping the streets below. They pressed back against the building until it passed.
"Split up?" Leyla suggested after the rotor noise faded.
Aya nodded, mind already working through logistics. "You and Amina hit the historical archives. See if you can find any municipal records about glass or lens workshops in old Kadıköy. Cross-reference with what we found in the cemetery."
"All the government buildings will be chaos with the protests," Leyla warned.
"Exactly," Amina interjected. "Perfect cover. Security will be focused on the streets, not researchers inside."
"What about us?" Karim asked.
"Back to the apartment," Aya decided. "We need to get to my father's other notebooks, compare everything. See what else he discovered about Ayn-ı Semavi. There might be connections we missed."
"Rendezvous, habibi?" Amina asked, already scanning Google Maps for the clearest route north toward the archives.
"Text on our secure line when you're clear, and we can find a secure place to compare anything we uncover." Aya touched Amina's arm briefly. "And I know you’re getting antsy for some action, but be careful.”
Amina’s eyes held Aya’s. "You too.”
They split into pairs, Amina and Leyla heading north through the backstreets while Aya and Karim took a circuitous route back to their apartment that Omar had rented, avoiding main thoroughfares and keeping to the shadows of Kadıköy's older buildings. As they separated, Aya caught Amina's eye. A flicker of shared caution passed between them that neither voiced. Then Amina turned and followed Leyla into the crowd.



The apartment felt like a sanctuary after the morning's chaos. Aya dead-bolted the door behind them and immediately moved to the windows, scanning the street below, while Karim checked all their sensors. No sign of surveillance.
"Clear?" Karim asked, already spreading the architectural drawing across the dining table.
"For now." Aya helped him weigh down the corners with coffee cups. The aged paper wanted to curl back into its centuries-old roll.
In the clearer light of their apartment, their eyes newly flushed with water and soothed with eye drops, the drawing's details were even more impressive. The workshop layout was meticulously planned, with separate areas for different stages of lens crafting. Annotations in Ottoman script filled the margins, some in what might have been Çelebi's own hand, others added later in slightly darker ink.
"This level of precision, wow," Karim murmured, tracing the equipment specifications with a reverent finger. "Whoever drafted this understood optical principles far beyond my understanding. I need to study whether any of these theories have ever even been published."
Aya retrieved her father's other notebooks, along with his other journals, which they'd brought from Morocco. She spread them out beside the architectural drawing, looking for connections.
"I think—yes. Here," she said, finding the relevant section. "My father tried to sketch something similar. Look at this lens configuration he was guessing at."
The page showed Hassan's interpretation of what appeared to be the same focusing mechanism depicted in Çelebi's workshop plans. Her father had added contemporary physics notations, trying to understand the principles behind the design.
"These equations," Karim said, leaning in to study Hassan's calculations. "He's describing energy amplification through crystalline lattice structures. But the mathematics..." He shook his head. "Some of this looks like extremely theoretical physics.”
Aya turned pages, finding more of her father's dense notations. Sketches of lens configurations, refractive indices, and calculations for focal lengths. And everywhere, the same symbol. An eye within radiating lines.
"Multiple components are the difference in Çelebi’s sketch," Karim observed, tracing the connections between elements. "Not just one lens, but a system of lenses. Primary focusing element here, secondary amplification array here, and this..." He pointed to a central chamber in the diagram. "This looks like a containment vessel."
"But what did Çelebi use it for?"
"That's the question, isn't it? It’s not like we’ve mastered the ability to harness energy from deep space. Maybe it’s too volatile, like with the Amulet of Idris, and Çelebi found out the hard way." Karim moved to another of Hassan's journals, flipping through pages. "We only have this bit here."
He pointed to a cryptic passage, written in Hassan's personal shorthand: “Doesn't create energy—channels what exists. Cosmic background radiation, stellar emissions, and darker sources. Ottoman 'celestial fire.' Zero-point energy. ???”
The entry ended abruptly.
"If this is real, if Aegis gets this technology, I think the implications are far worse than the Amulet of Idris in the Atlas.” Karim shook his head. 
"They won't. We won’t let them." Aya injected her voice with far more confidence than she felt. She hated to see Karim lose his enthusiasm. And she hated that her mind couldn’t stop worrying about how Amina was doing.
"How can you be so sure?"
She met his eyes across the table. "Because we’ve stopped them before. And I’ve seen what we can all do together. You’re amazing, and I can’t imagine anyone on their side could outsmart you.”
Karim walked behind her and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her tight. "I hope you’re right. And we’ll do whatever it takes."
Aya turned and kissed him. She wanted to put all his worries at ease, push all other thoughts from her head.
His lips were soft against hers as he drove her backward until her thighs found the desk. He lifted her onto the desktop and tugged her shift free while she fumbled with the belt at his hips.
"We should probably finish our research," she murmured against his lips, not making any move to pull away.
"Definitely," he agreed, already walking her backward toward the bedroom, his mouth never leaving hers.
They stumbled through the doorway, shedding the rest of their clothes as they went. They laughed between kisses, the urgency making them clumsy. When Karim's hands slid along the curve of her spine, her laughter dissolved into a sharp intake of breath.
"God, I want you," he whispered, his voice rough with desire as he guided her to the bed. “I can’t believe we have some alone time.”
Aya pulled him down on top of her, appreciating the heat of his skin against hers. She ran her hands over the lean muscles of his back.
His mouth moved to her neck before working his way down as she arched against him, a soft moan escaping her throat while his hands mapped every inch of her, firm.
As he worked his way back up, Karim whispered Aya’s name against her ear, and she answered by pulling him closer, deeper. Then she flipped them, straddling him, hair tumbling in curls down her chest. Karim’s hands cupped her waist, guiding while Aya took control.
When they finished, relief washed over them both in trembling waves, together, leaving Aya clinging to him.
They lay side-by-side afterward, skin cooling in the late afternoon air, neither willing to break the spell with words. Karim's fingers traced idle patterns on her shoulder while her head rested on his chest, rising and falling with each breath.
"That was..." he began, but seemed unable to find the right word.
"Exactly why I had us come back to the apartment," Aya finished for him, smiling.
He laughed, the sound vibrating through his chest beneath her ear. "I was going to say 'perfect,' but I couldn’t agree more. I’ve never been happier with one of your plans."
She propped herself up on an elbow to look at him, suddenly struck by the vulnerability in his eyes. For all his intellect and growing boldness, there was still something wonderfully open about him, something untouched by the darkness they faced.
Chapter 9
Aya checked her phone for the third time in ten minutes. Still nothing from Amina. 
"She's fine," Karim said from the bed, still tangled in the sheets. "Probably just buried in ledgers and losing track of time." 
"Probably." 
But Aya's instincts prickled. Amina always checked in. Always. She paced to the window, watching the city lights begin to sparkle as the sun descended. 
Behind her, she felt Karim's presence, his warmth as he wrapped his arms around her naked body. 
"When this is over," he said quietly, "when we've stopped Aegis for good, what happens to us?" The question caught her off guard. 
"What do you want to happen?" she asked.
"I want to keep waking up next to you. Preferably without anyone trying to kill us." His voice was soft but serious. "I want us to be together. Actually together. Not just between crises."
Aya smiled and squeezed him tight. "That does sound nice."
You don’t get both vengeance and happily ever after, she warned herself. But she’d been in this exact position before, with Amina, and she wanted to try harder this time.
"I'm serious." He tilted her chin up to meet his eyes. "I want us to be together."
The slight shake in his voice made her throat tight. "Me too," Aya whispered, and kissed him again, slower this time. She knew she meant it, she just wasn’t sure how to balance it with all the other things she knew she meant, too.
Eventually, hunger drove them from bed, and they tossed on some nondescript clothes.
"That place we saw, Zeytin?" Karim suggested as they locked up. "It's quiet, really nice outdoor space. And it looks chilled out in case we hear from Amina, so she and Leyla could meet us there."
"Sounds delightful.”
The walk was peaceful, the evening air cool against their skin. Any sign of a protest had vanished, leaving the streets to their usual evening crowd: couples walking hand in hand, groups of friends heading to bars, the flow of Istanbul life.
Zeytin Kafe & Bar welcomed them with a garden-style layout, nestled on a tree-lined side street, a lush oasis in the heart of the city. Massive trees rose through the wooden decking, their trunks wrapped with fairy lights that cast a warm glow across the wooden tables.
"This is perfect," Aya said, taking in the leafy canopy overhead and the gravel underfoot. "Good call."
They chose a table near the back corner, where they could sit with their backs to the wall and maintain sight lines to both entrances. A waitress approached with menus.
"Thanks, but we know what we want. Two Guinness, please," Karim said.
"And two of the mantar soslu döküm burgers," Aya added. “That’s the mushroom sauce, right?”
As the waitress confirmed and walked away, a large orange tabby cat appeared from beneath a nearby table, stretching languidly before sauntering over to inspect the newcomers. He paused at Aya's feet, looking up with imperious amber eyes.
"Hello there," she murmured, reaching down to offer her hand for inspection.
"Resident security system," Karim joked as the cat rubbed against Aya's hand and she petted his head. "When I was looking, I read a review of this place that mentioned Sultan. Apparently, he's quite selective about who he graces with his presence."
The cat gave Aya's fingers a cursory sniff before hopping onto the empty chair between them, curling into a tight ball of fur.
"I'm honored," Aya said, scratching behind Sultan's ears. “He reminds me of the street cat that lived at Salah’s in Essaouira, Marmalade.”
Their beers arrived, still settling, dark and velvety with creamy heads. The first sip was a welcome change from the rakı.
"Şerefe," Karim toasted, raising his glass.
"B’saha," Aya added.
They clinked glasses, tapped them on the table, and took a drink. For the moment, with the dappled light playing through the leaves above and the soft murmur of conversation around them, Aya could almost pretend they were just another couple enjoying Istanbul's night scene.
To be fair, she considered, they’d gotten to enjoy Istanbul, and each other, far more than she’d expected to for being essentially at war with the Aegis.
Their burgers arrived steaming on wooden boards. Thick patties topped with a rich mushroom sauce that spilled over the sides of the brioche buns. Hand-cut fries filled the remainder of the board, sprinkled with herbs and sea salt.
"You know, it’s crazy," Karim said, "six months ago I was cataloging broken pottery shards and writing grant proposals in the dust of the Atlas Mountains. Mythological artifacts, shadowy conspiracies, these were all Indiana Jones to me. Now I'm decoding Ottoman star maps and running from corporate mercenaries."
"Regrets?" Aya asked, sipping her Guinness.
"None." His answer was immediate, certain. "Well, maybe the tear gas. But everything else? Worth it."
They ordered another round of Guinness and then shared a plate of köfte with roasted vegetables. Sultan remained curled on the chair, occasionally opening one eye to monitor their progress, particularly when the köfte arrived.
"I think this should be our first stop," Karim said, his voice lowering, "when this is all over, I'd like to come back to Turkey. Properly. See the sites, visit the museums. Maybe even find some legitimate archaeological work."
"I'd like that too," Aya replied, her hand finding his across the table. “We could work together.”
The garden was illuminated entirely by string lights now, creating their own canopy of stars beneath the actual night sky that had been Çelebi’s focus 500 years prior. The lamppost in the center cast pools of light across the gravel, while the small lime-green building at the back housed the kitchen and bar, its windows glowing warmly. Sultan suddenly perked up, ears swiveling toward the entrance before he disappeared beneath another table. 
A moment later, Aya's phone buzzed against the wooden tabletop. A message from Amina had come in, and Aya tried to mask just how relieved she was to see that Amina was okay. “Archives were a goldmine. Heading back now. You won't believe what we found.”
"Looks like we're back on," Aya said, showing Karim the screen.
"I guess that's the end of our nice, quiet evening." He drained the last of his Guinness. "But I'm so glad we got to have it, especially with what lies ahead."
Aya leaned across the table and kissed him, then stood. "I'll go get the bill."
Her phone buzzed again before she could rise. 



Three blocks away, Amina and Leyla emerged from the archives into the cooling evening air.
"So you'll head back to meet them?" Leyla asked, checking her watch. "I should get home, organize what we found."
"Yeah." Amina pulled out her phone, typing quickly. "I want to compare the workshop registrations against Hassan's cemetery coordinates. See if there's overlap."
"Sounds good. Tomorrow morning?"
Amina nodded, but her eyes remained guarded. She'd been watching Leyla all day. The way she knew exactly which bureaucrat to charm, which records room held the oldest ledgers, which archive clerk owed favors, which probing questions about Hassan’s research she slipped in while Amina was distracted. Too smooth. Too connected for someone supposedly blacklisted from academia.
"See you then," Amina said, then added casually, "Thanks for your help today. You know your way around."
"Years of research." Leyla’s eyes widened slightly, then she smiled. "You learn the systems."
They separated at the corner, Leyla heading north while Amina turned toward the apartment. But Amina didn't move right away. She waited, watching Leyla's retreating figure, noting the way she glanced back once, just once, before disappearing around a corner.
Something was wrong. She typed another message to Aya: "One more thing…"



Leyla waited until she was two blocks away, certain Amina wasn't following, before ducking into the alcove of a shuttered newsstand. She pulled out the burner phone Malik had given her and dialed.
He answered on the second ring. "Report."
"We found workshop registrations from 1580. Three confirmed locations in Kadıköy that match the cemetery pattern. But there's a problem."
"Go on."
Leyla's grip tightened on the phone. "Amina. She's suspicious. Has been all day. Watching me, testing me with questions, and noting how I move. I think she's going to warn Aya."
Silence on the line, then: "How certain are you?"
"Very. She's good, better than I anticipated. If they start questioning me directly tomorrow, my cover won't hold."
"Then we don't wait until tomorrow." Malik's voice shifted, became calculating. "Where is she now?"
"Walking back to their apartment. Alone. Sent Aya ahead to the restaurant."
"Perfect. I'll have a team intercept her. You stay clear and establish your alibi. Be seen in a public place for the next two hours."
Leyla's stomach twisted. "What are you going to do to her?"
"Nothing permanent. We need her suspicious nature redirected toward gratitude." A pause. "And you're going to be the one she's grateful to. My men will make it messy enough to be convincing, but leave enough breadcrumbs for you to follow. You'll arrive with backup, eliminate a few expendable assets, and extract her heroically. After that, her suspicions will seem like paranoia."
"You want me to kill your own people?"
"Three or four operatives are meaningless compared to what we're building. And Dr. Yilmaz, the alignment is approaching. We can't afford delays." His voice hardened. "This accelerates the timeline. Once you've rescued her, they'll trust you completely. You push them toward the remaining component locations. Hard. No more delays."
Leyla thought of Emre. His face in that last video Malik had shown her, gaunt but alive. "I understand."
"Good. Get to a café, order dinner, and pay with a credit card. I'll contact you when it's time for your heroic rescue."
The line went dead.
Leyla stood in the shadows, phone heavy in her hand. Somewhere ahead, Amina was walking into a trap Leyla had just armed.


Another message from Amina came through on Aya’s phone, which she read in disbelief.
"One more thing. I don't fully trust Leyla. Something's off. She knew exactly where to find records today. Asked a lot of questions about Hassan's notes on component locations. Maybe I'm paranoid, but my gut says she's not telling us everything. Watch yourself, and don’t discuss anything sensitive with her until we talk."
Aya showed Karim the message, who frowned.
"She did know a lot about surveillance infrastructure during the protest," he said slowly. "For an academic."
"But Omar vouched for her," Aya reasoned, though the words felt hollow even as she said them.
Karim shrugged.
Aya pocketed her phone. "We'll talk to her tomorrow. All of us. Clear the air."
But a small knot of stress had formed in her stomach that the Guinness couldn't dissolve.
They walked back slowly, arms linked against the cooling night air. The streets were quieter now, most shops closed, only occasional groups of partiers passing by. The domestic normalcy of it struck Aya: walking home after dinner, slightly buzzed, discussing mundane things like whether they needed to buy coffee for the morning. She liked it.
“Did you hear that?” Karim asked, stopping abruptly, alarmed.
They were a block from their building when she heard it for the second time. A muffled cry, sharp and suddenly cut off.
"That sounded like—" Karim began.
But Aya was already running.
She rounded the corner at full sprint, just in time to see a black sedan pulling away from the curb two buildings ahead, followed by the screech of tires. Through the rear window, illuminated briefly by a streetlight, she caught a glimpse of a struggle—dark hair, hands pressed against glass.
Then Amina's face appeared as she thrashed about on the inside, pressed close to the window. Their eyes met, Aya’s wide with panic and Amina’s narrowed with rage. Her mouth formed words Aya couldn't hear through the glass.
The car's tires squealed again as it accelerated downhill, tearing through the quiet street. Aya pushed herself harder, boots pounding pavement.
Then the car swept around the corner and vanished into the Istanbul night.
"Amina!" Aya screamed, skidding to a halt at the intersection. Her voice echoed off the buildings, answered only by the fading growl of the sedan's engine.
Karim caught up, breathing hard. "Was that—"
"They took her." Aya's voice was deadly calm. "Aegis has Amina."
Chapter 10
The car's taillights disappeared around the corner, taking Amina with them. Aya stood frozen in the middle of the street, her scream still echoing off the apartment buildings.
"License plate?" Karim gasped, hands on his knees as he caught his breath beside her.
"Too dark," Aya replied, eyes fixed on the empty street, panting out the words. "Black sedan, tinted windows. Maybe government plates. They were white with red text. Heading north toward the Bosphorus. And where’s Leyla? They might have her, too."
"We need to call the police."
Aya shook her head sharply. "And tell them what? That an international shadow organization just kidnapped our friend? We'd spend the night in interrogation while they search our apartment and find everything."
"Then what's the plan?" Karim straightened, voice rising with panic. "We can't just let them take her!"
"I'm thinking!" Aya snapped, picturing a series of horrible fates that could await Amina if they didn’t act quickly, then softened. "Sorry. Let me call her first. Maybe they want to talk."
She pulled out her phone with trembling fingers and dialed Amina's number. Straight to voicemail.
"Damn it." She lowered the phone, mind racing. "We need to get back in the apartment, then figure out our next move."
"You think she'll be okay?" Karim asked as they started jogging back toward their building.
Aya's pace quickened. "I don’t know. She's survived worse."
"But these are the same people who—"
"I know exactly who they are," Aya cut him off. "And so does Amina."
They turned back onto their street, both scanning for any sign of more Aegis operatives. The night felt suddenly hostile, shadows deepened, sounds amplified.
"She'll fight," Karim said, his voice uncertain as they approached their building. "She wouldn't go down easily."
"No, she wouldn't," Aya agreed, then added after a hesitation, "But she's also a survivor first."
"What does that mean?" Karim asked, casting her a sideways glance.
Aya slowed her pace slightly, regretting the words that were about to come out of her mouth. "In Egypt, when things went bad... she chose herself. Left me to deal with the consequences."
"But she came back in Morocco, she didn’t leave us."
"You’re right. But it was different circumstances." Aya's voice tightened. "She came back because it aligned with her interests."
"You don't really believe that," Karim challenged. "I've seen how committed she is to our cause. How she looks at you."
Aya didn't answer immediately, unsure of Karim’s intent. When she did, her voice was softer. "That's what scares me. If they figure out how much she cares..." She shook her head. "Amina, with nothing to lose, is dangerous. Amina, with something to protect, is vulnerable. I just hope she can tap back into the former if she needs to."
They reached their building and climbed the stairs in tense silence, each lost in their own thoughts.
"Maybe she'll escape on her own," Karim ventured as they approached their floor. "She's resourceful, clever. She might have already—"
He stopped mid-sentence. Their apartment door hung ajar again, only this time the wood around the lock was splintered.
Aya drew the knife from her boot. "Stay behind me."
"Like hell," Karim whispered. "We go in together."
She nodded, a fleeting smile of appreciation crossing her face before her expression hardened again. They pushed the door open with synchronized caution.
The apartment was dark, but enough streetlight filtered through the windows to reveal the destruction inside. The coffee table lay overturned. Sofa cushions had been slashed open, white stuffing spilling out like wounds. In the kitchen, every cabinet stood open, contents strewn across the counters.
"Clear the bedrooms," Aya whispered. "Don't touch anything they might have rigged."
They moved through the apartment methodically, clearing each room. The devastation was thorough. Mattresses were flipped, drawers were emptied, and even the bathroom medicine cabinet was ransacked. But their most valuable items, the documents from the cemetery and Hassan's notebooks, were still in Aya's bag, which hadn't left her side all evening.
"Look," Karim said from the living room.
He stood by the overturned coffee table, pointing at the floor. Dark droplets led from the entrance toward the kitchen. Blood, still wet.
"She fought back," Aya said, kneeling to examine the trail. "Made them work for it."
"You sound proud," Karim said.
"I am." Aya touched the droplets lightly. "Let's hope it's their blood, not hers."
Her phone buzzed with a message from Leyla: “Finally made it home. Archive materials are secure. Have you all linked up yet? When should we meet tomorrow?”
"Shit. We need to warn her," Karim said, reading over Aya's shoulder.
Aya was already typing: “Get somewhere safe asap. They took Amina. Your place could be compromised. Meet us at the backup location at dawn. Come armed. Tell no one.”
“I don’t know where to start,” Aya sighed. “We need to find her.”
Karim put his hands on her shoulders. "What would Amina do if our positions were reversed?"
"Find me, and kill anyone who stood in her way with no consideration of any consequences," she answered immediately. "I mean us, stalk whoever took us, and end them."
Aya’s mind flashed back to Egypt. Being left for dead, watching the woman she loved flee to safety. But that was then. How quickly the old assurances had come back.
"Wait,” Aya said. “Her phone."
"You said it went to voicemail."
"Yes, but..." Aya navigated to her contacts, found Amina's entry. "There's a small chance that if Amina’s been putting up enough of a fight that the tracking hasn't been disabled yet because they’ve been too busy trying to restrain her. It looked like they only had two guys on her, plus the driver. Should work even as long as the battery hasn’t been pulled."
She tapped the icon. A map opened, showing their current location. She held her breath and refreshed the screen.
A blue dot appeared across Kadıköy, moving slowly through the streets.
"Got her," Aya breathed. "She's about two kilometers northeast. Moving slowly."
"Or someone has her phone," Karim pointed out.
"Then we find that someone, and figure out why they have our friend’s phone." Aya was already heading for the door. "Either way, it's our only lead."
They descended the stairs two at a time, bursting onto the street. The blue dot on Aya's screen moved steadily through Istanbul, leading them away from the waterfront into an older, more industrial area.
"Wait," Karim said after they'd gone six blocks. "Stop for a second."
"We can't stop. We're losing—"
"No, listen." He pulled her into a doorway. "We're being followed."
“Sorry, you’re right. Good catch.” Aya pulled out her phone, angling it to use the screen's reflection. Behind them, about thirty meters back, two figures in dark outfits had stopped when they did, lurking about a block behind them.
"I see them," she continued. "They're not trying very hard to hide."
"Maybe they want us to know they're there."
"Or they're herding us." Aya studied the map again. Amina's signal had stopped moving, hovering over a building another two kilometers ahead. "We need to lose them before we get there."
They slipped out of the doorway, maintaining their previous pace. At the next intersection, they turned right, then immediately ducked into an alley. They pressed against the wall, listening for footsteps.
The suits passed by the alley entrance, then stopped. Aya could hear them speaking to each other in rapid Turkish.
"Now," Aya whispered.
They sprinted down the alley, emerging onto a busier street filled with bars and restaurants.
"There." Karim pointed to a pub with a green awning and glowing Guinness sign: Teacher's Pub. Through the windows, they could see it was crowded, with what looked like live music starting.
They pushed through the door into a wave of warmth and noise. It was everything Aya could hope for in the moment—dimly lit, packed with people, and loud enough to swallow conversation. The interior was all dark wood and brass fixtures, walls decorated with vintage photographs and beer advertisements. A small stage in the corner hosted a guitarist just beginning his set, the opening chords competing with the crowd's chatter.
They wound their way to the bar, which ran along the wall beneath shelves crowded with bottles and beer steins. The bartender, a broad-shouldered man with long salt-and-pepper hair, raised his eyebrows in question.
"Guinness," Karim called over the noise, holding up two fingers.
While they waited for their drinks, Aya scanned the pub. Tables filled the main floor, each surrounded by groups deep in animated conversation. More seating lined the windows, offering views of the street, not ideal for their purposes. A darker section toward the back looked more promising.
Their beers arrived. Aya paid with cash and then led Karim toward the rear of the pub, where they found a small table partially obstructed behind a wooden pillar but with a view to the door.
"Can you still track her?" Karim asked once they'd settled.
Aya checked her phone. "Signal's stationary. About six blocks from here. Either that’s where she is, that’s where they shut it off, or that’s where they ditched her phone." She took a long drink of the Guinness, helping to calm her racing thoughts.
“Or that’s where they want to lure us,” Karim said.
Aya shot him a severe look.
The guitarist finished tuning and launched into a cover of something Aya knew was by Radiohead but couldn’t name. The crowd quieted slightly, attention turning toward the small stage.
"Sorry, we’ll find her," Karim said, leaning close to be heard. "And this is smart. Hiding in plain sight. Just like Çelebi’s gravestones. How long until we head toward her signal?"
"We wait fifteen minutes, make sure we've lost our tail, then move."
“Solid plan.”
"Amina would already be three moves ahead." Aya's hand tightened on her glass.
"Hey." Karim massaged her leg under the table. "We'll find her. She's tough."
"Salah’s tough, and I keep picturing how broken he was when we rescued him in the Sahara base. Tough doesn't stop the Aegis."
"Neither does stress or guilt. But we need to let Leyla know what’s up."
Aya’s thumbs flew over her encrypted chat: “Hot zone. Aegis tail. In Teacher Pub. Going dark & relocating after we locate Amina.”
Three dots pulsed, then Leyla’s reply popped: “Copy. See you at fallback rendezvous from this morning if burned.” 
Before Aya could respond, the pub door opened again. Two men entered and stood just inside the entrance, scanning the crowd methodically.
"Don't turn around," Aya murmured. "Two potentials. Stiff, alert."
"Our friends?"
"Different ones. But they’re slightly too clean-cut for this place. Vibe’s off."
The men began moving through the pub, checking each table with professional thoroughness. The music and crowd provided cover, but it wouldn't hide them for long.
"Kitchen?" Karim suggested, nodding toward a swinging door marked "Staff Only" behind the bar.
"They'll have someone watching the back if they came in so brazenly. We could take them, but if we start a fight in here, we’re all going to jail."
The men were halfway through the room. In moments, they'd reach the rear section.
Aya made a split-second decision. She pulled Karim close and kissed him, angling their bodies to shield their faces from the searching men. Not the most original trick, she thought, but sometimes classics worked best.
She kept one eye slightly open, watching the reflection in a brass beer tap behind the bar. They paused, scanned past the embracing couple, then continued toward the back of the pub.
"Now," she whispered against Karim's lips.
They slipped from their table, moving swiftly but not obviously toward the front entrance. Their pursuers were still checking the pub, pretending to be looking for a good spot to see the music. 
The guitarist launched into a louder song, the crowd responding with enthusiasm that mercifully got everyone standing and swaying along.
Aya and Karim were three steps from the door when one of the men turned.
Their eyes met across the crowded pub. For a heartbeat, everything froze. Then the man's hand moved toward his jacket.
Aya didn't wait to see what he was reaching for. She grabbed Karim's hand and yanked him outside through the open door, breaking into a run the moment they hit the street.
Aya pulled out her phone without breaking stride, checking Amina's location. Still stationary, now five blocks northeast.
They cut through an alley, vaulted a low fence, and emerged onto a quieter street lined with shuttered shops. Behind them, footsteps echoed. Their pursuers had cleared the pub and were giving chase.
"This way," Aya hissed, pulling Karim into another alley, then behind a dumpster, crouched low, then spun around as their two pursuers rounded the corner.
Aya clocked the movement, and the CCTV dome above the alley. No shots, she calculated. Too many phones. One discharge in Kadıköy and counter‑terror units would flood the grid, and whatever shield Aegis was hiding behind would evaporate.
The first man was drawing his weapon when Aya closed the distance in three fluid strides. She caught his gun hand at the wrist, twisted sharply, and drove her knee into his forearm. The weapon clattered away as he cried out. Without pause, she pivoted and swept his legs, sending him crashing face-first into the brick wall.
The second pursuer had his gun half-drawn when Aya spun toward him. She ducked under his panicked swing and rose behind his guard. Her palm strike caught him just under the jaw, snapping his head back. As he staggered, she grabbed his jacket and used his momentum to slam him into the opposite wall.
Both men lay unconscious on the cobblestones. Karim stood frozen, holding an empty crate he'd grabbed from the dumpster. 
"Help me search them," Aya said, already moving. They found two phones and two radios.
Aya quickly crushed the radios under her heel, then straightened. "Now we run."
Three blocks. Amina's signal hadn't moved.
They approached the building cautiously. It was an aged, nondescript commercial structure, five stories of weathered concrete with rows of grimy, stained windows. No lights, no obvious security, just a metal door with a keypad lock.
"We need to get inside," Karim whispered.
Aya was already examining the keypad. The buttons were worn unevenly. 2, 5, 7, and 9 showed the most use. She tried several combinations before the lock clicked open on 5-9-7-2.
The door revealed a stairwell illuminated with flickering fluorescents. They climbed quickly but quietly, following the tracker to the third floor. The signal led them down a hallway past several unmarked doors to what appeared to be an abandoned office suite from the early 2000s.
This door wasn't locked. It swung open at Aya's touch, revealing a large room with overturned desks, stacks of chairs, and scattered papers. The windows had been covered with newspaper, letting in just enough streetlight to navigate.
"There," Karim said, pointing.
On the floor near the far wall lay a phone, Amina's phone, its screen cracked but still functioning.
"Oh god," Aya breathed.
The wall was splattered with blood, still wet, dripping down the cracked plaster. More blood pooled on the floor, far too much for anyone to lose and survive.
But there was no body.
Aya knelt beside the phone, her need for action warring with rising panic. She forced herself to observe, to analyze. The blood spatter was wrong somehow, but she couldn’t place it.
"It's staged," she realized. "Look at the splatter. It's not from impact. Someone threw this blood against the wall."
"To make us think..."
"That she's dead." Aya picked up Amina's phone, noting the deliberate placement. "They wanted us to find this. Wanted us to think we were too late."
A slow clap echoed from the doorway.
They spun to find Malik standing in the entrance, flanked by four men with guns drawn. His expression was somewhere between amusement and respect.
"Very good, Ms. Amrani," he said. "That only took you seconds. You may be every bit as perceptive as your father. However, you did still willingly run into this building without any reconnaissance, and against any proper training, so not exactly full marks.”
Aya rose slowly, Amina's broken phone still in her hand. "Where is she?"
"Safe. For now." Malik stepped further into the room, his men fanning out to block any escape. "Whether she stays that way depends entirely on you."
"What do you want?"
"What I've always wanted. What your father died trying to hide." His eyes glittered in the dim light. "I want you to finish his work, Aya. I want you to find the Astral Lens. And I want you to give it to me."
The blood on the wall continued its slow drip, counting out the seconds in the sudden silence.
Chapter 11
Malik's words stung like the tear gas that still clung to the back of Aya's throat. She closed her fingers on Amina’s broken phone until the cracked glass cut in. Blood had started to congeal on the wall; its metallic smell cut through the abandoned building's dust. Four men in black framed Malik, rifles lowered, but hungry for a reason to raise them.
"Well," Aya said, her voice steady as she clocked the rifles, calculating their odds. "Now we know what you want. I want you to tell me where Amina is, and to never talk about my father again."
Malik's smile was patient, almost paternal. "Your loyalty is admirable, Ms. Amrani. Your father had the same quality. It's what made him so formidable."
"I believe I just asked you not to talk about my father."
"Hassan understood what was at stake. The lens could reshape our understanding of our place in the universe. Help us understand what natural resources are really at our disposal. It could expand space travel, push us further into the future than any modern technology could ever dream of. Hassan knew this.”
"And you killed him for it."
Malik stepped further into the room, his polished shoes avoiding the staged blood pool. "You’ve been misled. I'm offering you a choice. Work with us. Complete your father's research. Help us find the lens."
"Or what? You'll kill us just like him?"
"I did not kill your father," Malik said calmly.
The words hit bone. Lies or truth, Aya considered. Her nails dug into her palm around the phone.
Malik gestured to his men. "The lens exists. Your activities today prove you're close to finding it. Why not benefit from what you discover instead of fighting a losing battle? Imagine clean energy beyond anything currently possible. 
“Scientific, controllable, not like the djinn. Your father was brilliant but shortsighted. He couldn't see past centuries of superstition to grasp the opportunity. You saw the potential of the Amulet of Idris in Morocco to harness unthinkable energy. Join us, and have a leading voice in how it’s used, free from blunt instruments like Léglise. We are not him. We are not his organization. He went rogue and double-crossed even us.”
Aya glanced at Karim. His face was taut with tension, but his eyes were alert, calculating angles and distances. Four guns plus Malik. No good options for escape.
A muffled thud came from somewhere deeper in the building.
Malik frowned. "What was—"
Another thud, followed by a strangled cry that cut off abruptly.
One of the operatives clicked his radio. "Team Two, report."
Static.
"Team Two, respond."
More static. Then, faintly: "...need backup... she's..."
The transmission ended in a gurgle.
Malik's composure cracked. "You two, check the south corridor. Now."
The two men moved toward the door. They'd barely crossed the threshold when a body crashed into them from the hallway—another man dressed in a dark hoodie, his throat slit. 
The collision sent all three sprawling.
A smoke canister clinked across the floor, then another from the hall, and gray swallowed the room.
A voice in Turkish barked outside the door.
Automatic fire ripped through the haze, muzzle flashes strobing.
Aya grabbed Karim and dove behind a support beam as bullets chewed into the wall where they'd been standing. Through the smoke, she could make out struggling figures, the sharp screams of pain.
Then, through the chaos, a familiar voice: "Stay down!"
Leyla burst through the smoke, assault rifle in her hands. She fired controlled bursts, driving Malik's remaining men toward the windows. Behind her came Amina, bloodied and with a slight limp, but very much alive, a combat knife in each hand.
Amina moved like Aya had seen countless times, closing with surgical precision on one of Malik's operatives. The man turned to fire, but she was already inside his guard. Her knives found two gaps between his body armor plates. He dropped with a wet gasp.
"Fall back!" Malik shouted, firing blindly through the smoke as he retreated toward the door.
“I’m coming for you, Malik,” Amina yelled. “You will die. It may not be right now, but it will be very, very soon.”
Leyla advanced, laying down a relentless volley of gunfire. Her jittery, academic demeanor had vanished, replaced by something harder, professional. She moved surgically, checking corners, controlling lanes of fire.
Half a minute later, the gunfire thinned; Malik and the survivors were already gone. The smoke began to clear, revealing three bodies on the floor, all wearing Aegis tactical gear.
"Amina!" Aya called and rushed to her side.
Blood ran from a gash above Amina's eye, and she favored her left leg as she walked, but she bared a grin that almost concealed the pain in her eyes. "Hey, babe. You miss me?"
"How did you… What happened?"
"Let's not have this conversation here," Leyla interrupted, slinging the rifle over her shoulder. "He’ll be back with reinforcements if we linger. We need to move. We were lucky."
They helped Amina down the stairs and out through a service entrance. Leyla led them through a maze of back alleys, hopping a fence, and emerging in an unfamiliar, residential section of the city.
"Where were you?" Aya asked as they hurried through the night. "After they took you—"
"They grabbed me as I entered our apartment," Amina said, grimacing as she limped. "Black bag treatment, and eventually tranquilized me in the car. Woke up in that building with Malik asking questions about the lens, about what we'd found today."
"How did you escape?"
"I didn't. Leyla found me." Amina glanced at their companion, and a complicated expression passed across her face, gratitude wrestling with the suspicion she'd harbored hours earlier. The suspicion was lost. "Turns out our new friend has some serious skills."
"After your messages, I called in some old contacts for backup," Leyla said. "When they separated to search for you two, we made our move."
"And you killed those men," Karim said, studying her from a few paces behind.
Leyla shrugged. "Yeah, they would have killed us. The Aegis doesn't leave witnesses."
She led them to a shabby apartment building, its facade crumbling but distinct. They climbed four flights of protesting stairs to a heavy wooden door marked only with a number.
"A safe house," Leyla said, producing a key. "Not on any of my official records. Who knows what else is compromised."
Inside was a sparse but functional space: mattresses on the floor, basic kitchen facilities, and walls lined with maps of Istanbul. Heavy curtains covered the windows, and Aya noted the exits: main door, fire escape, and direct access to the roof.
"So, I take it you're not just an archaeologist who did a little work for Omar in the past," Aya said, helping Amina to one of the mattresses.
"Well, I am an archaeologist," Leyla corrected, finding a first-aid kit. "But the Turkish intelligence service paid for my graduate studies. In exchange, I occasionally helped with operations that are easier to access as a scholar."
"You're a spy."
"Was. Past tense. I left that life behind years ago." She began cleaning Amina's wounds. "But old habits and old contacts can be useful when death squads come calling."
As Leyla worked on Amina's injuries, Aya noticed her friend’s hands shaking slightly, the adrenaline wearing off, and reality setting in.
"They knew everything," Amina said quietly. "About the cemetery, the inscriptions, what we found. They have people watching every move we make."
"Not every move," Karim said. "They didn't know about Leyla's safe house."
"Give them time." Amina's voice was bitter. "I'm starting to think we're in over our heads, again. Malik has resources we can't match, just like in Morocco. Maybe we should—"
"What? Give up?" Aya sat beside her. "Let them win?"
"Survive." Amina met her eyes. "I've been doing this long enough to know when the odds are impossible. We could walk away. Disappear. Let someone else be the hero."
"You don't mean that."
"Don't I?" Amina touched the fresh bandage on her forehead. "I didn't sign up to save the world, Aya. Maybe it's time I went back to what I'm good at."
Before Aya could respond, Karim's phone buzzed. He looked at the screen, brow furrowing in surprise.
"It's Salah."
They exchanged glances. They hadn’t heard from Salah or Omar directly since they’d arrived, and the current plan, communicated by Leyla, was radio silence except for emergencies.
"Answer it," Aya decided.
Salah's face appeared on the screen, his normally calm features tight with urgency. "Alhamdulillah. I've been trying to reach you for hours."
"We had some trouble," Aya said dryly. “How are you, Salah?”
"I'm hanging in there, man," Salah said, his voice carrying his familiar laid-back cadence despite the urgency in his eyes. He adjusted his position, wincing slightly as he leaned forward. "Leg's still giving me hell, but the doctors say I dodged any permanent damage." He flashed the easy grin Aya remembered, though it faded quickly.
His dreads were pulled back in a loose knot, and the healing scar on his temple caught the light when he turned. "Omar's been checking in, making sure I don't push too hard, but this tech stuff?" He tapped his laptop. "I don’t need my surf legs, you know? Been diving into these Aegis networks, riding the encryption all the way down."
He paused, his expression hardening, the same transformation Aya had witnessed in the Moroccan desert when danger closed in. "Listen, what I've found isn't good. Not good at all, brothers and sisters. Whatever chill we thought we bought ourselves after the Atlas? It's gone."
"I've been monitoring Aegis communications, waiting, watching. The good news is I’m in their system now, and I don’t think they have any idea. After today's events, that’s as good as confirmed. Their chatter exploded. They're not being as careful about encryption anymore. And they were not happy with how things went down in al-Maghrib or with how Léglise buried their op. They can’t have another repeat. They’re panicking about something.”
"About what?"
"Tomorrow. Something big is happening at noon. All their teams are being recalled to Istanbul. It sounds like they have operations right now in Phnom Penh, Tromso, Tbilisi, and outside Dar es Salaam, at least those are the ones that I know of." He leaned closer to the camera. "And I've been tracking their movements in Turkey through some hacked CCTV footage. You need to see this."
Salah clicked something loudly, and the screen shifted to grainy security footage from a camera that was definitely in Kadıköy. Aya watched as teams of Aegis operatives moved through the streets, clearly coordinating an operation.
"I've identified at least four dozen operators," Salah continued. "Plus support staff, vehicles, a boat on the Bosphorus. This isn't just a retrieval team; it's another small army, just like the Sahara. Their resources are barely dented."
"Can you identify their leadership?" Leyla asked, moving to look at the screen.
"Working on it. So far, I've got one match."
A clear image appeared: Malik, caught by a traffic camera, his hood pulled back to reveal his face.
"His name is Malik Osman. He’s German, a former spy for BND. But that's not the interesting part. Brace yourselves."
Salah sighed before he pulled up another image—older, grainier, but unmistakably the same man. He stood in what looked like an archaeological dig site, surrounded by other researchers.
"That's my father," Aya gasped.
"Taken eight years ago at a conference in San Jose," Salah confirmed. "They knew each other, Aya. Malik worked with your father."
Aya stared at the image, trying to reconcile the smiling young man standing next to her father with the cold professional who'd just tried to kill them. It hadn’t been bluster. He had known Hassan.
"I've been going through old academic databases, following the connections. Malik wasn't just at one event with your father. They frequently appeared at the same sites, the same conferences. Twice, they presented on the same panel. It would appear they were friends, Aya."
"You're saying Malik knew about the lens that long ago, before the Aegis," Karim said.
"I'm saying Malik might have been looking for it first. Your father's research into Çelebi and the Astral Lens? Those weren't brand new ideas he developed. He and Malik may have already been investigating those connections together. Then something happened.”
"And Malik joined Aegis," Leyla finished. "Or was recruited by them."
"The question is," Aya said, her voice hard, "did Malik betray my father?”
The safe house fell silent as the implications sank in.
"Whatever happened between them," Salah said finally, "Malik and Aegis want the lens badly enough to risk deploying an army that Erdoğan could safely claim is threatening Turkish sovereignty. Enough that they’re pulling resources from all their other projects. And based on what I'm seeing in these communications, he thinks you're the key to finding it somehow."
"Why me?" Aya asked. "Why not just follow the research he did with my father?"
"Maybe he tried. Maybe he hit the same dead ends your father did." Salah paused. "Or maybe there’s another personal connection, like how he left you clues for the Amulet. I don’t know."
"I need to see those papers," she said. "The ones Malik and my father presented together."
"Already sending them to Karim's phone," Salah replied. "But Aya... be careful. Malik isn't just some hired gun. He might know things about the lens that even you don't, and with his past… he’s the real deal."
The call ended, leaving them in tense silence. Amina had stopped talking about leaving. Leyla was already checking her weapons. And Karim was pulling up the first of the academic papers on his phone.
"'Astronomical Alignments in Ottoman Sacred Architecture,'" he read. "By Dr. Hassan Amrani and Malik Osman."
Aya leaned over to look at the screen. Her father's familiar writing style was there, but interwoven with another voice. One that was younger, eager, and equally brilliant. Together, they'd been mapping connections between Ottoman buildings and celestial events, tracing patterns.
"Oh my god," Aya whispered, seeing it suddenly. "They weren't just researching. They were following clues. These papers, the way they read—they're breadcrumbs. My father and Malik were documenting their actual hunt for the lens."
She grabbed the phone, scrolling rapidly through the document. "Look at this section. They're describing the Süleymaniye Mosque, but something's off about these measurements."
Karim pulled out his own phone. "Let me pull up the architectural guide." His fingers flew over the screen. "I've been wanting to visit it since we arrived, so I already downloaded some reference materials."
He held up his phone, showing detailed floor plans and elevation drawings. "These dimensions in your father's paper don't match the current building specifications at all."
"Maybe they made an error? Or were they referencing a historical version of the building?" Amina suggested.
"My father didn't make measurement errors," Aya said firmly. "And neither would Malik. They were both too meticulous."
Karim was comparing the documents side by side now. "Wait, look at this. The prayer hall dimensions in their paper show it's three meters narrower than the current structure. And this dome height calculation..." He paused, double-checking his math. "That's impossible given the existing supports."
Leyla leaned over to study both screens. "What if they weren't measuring the current mosque? Look at the date this was published. 2018. And here in the acknowledgments, they mention being 'unable to access sealed historical chambers due to structural concerns.'"
"What kind of structural concerns?" Aya asked.
Karim was already searching. "There were major earthquakes in the 17th and 18th centuries that damaged parts of the complex. Many chambers and passages were sealed off for safety." His eyes widened as he read further. "But there was restoration work between 2015 and 2018 that reinforced the foundations and restored damaged sections of the mosque... potentially made some of those sealed areas structurally sound again."
"Potentially making some of those sealed areas structurally sound again,” Aya said. "If the restoration work strengthened the foundations, those same chambers might be accessible again.”
“And any structural barriers that stopped them might no longer exist," Karim said.
"We need to get to the Süleymaniye," Aya said. "Tonight. Before Malik realizes we've figured this out."
"Are you insane?" Amina struggled to sit up. "You know Malik wrote that. He knows what it says, and for all we know, he leaked it to Salah. You want to walk into what's obviously a trap, again?"
"No. I want to get there first. My father and Malik were partners once, but something went wrong. Maybe my father discovered something about Malik's true intentions. Maybe that's why he ran, why he hid his research."
"Or maybe," Leyla said quietly, "your father discovered something about the lens itself. Something that made him realize it should never be found."
Outside, Istanbul waited, hiding secrets in its stones along with a new fuse, ready to be lit.
Chapter 12
Spotlights reflected off Süleymaniye Mosque’s minarets, piercing the darkness. Aya crouched in the shadows of a nearby building, her eyes fixed on the structure. The academic paper on her phone had become their unlikely guide so far.
"Four guard rotations," Amina whispered, lowering her binoculars from her partially bandaged head. "Two at the main entrance, one circling the perimeter. Another inside, stationary."
"They'll have security cameras, too," Leyla said. "But it’s just a typical mosque, no reason for heightened security. There’ll be blind spots. And the 2015–2018 retrofit shored up sealed substructures, but the camera grid still treats those passages as bricked off. Modern coverage misses the old ingress.”
Karim was absorbed in his phone, overlaying modern satellite images with 16th-century maps. "According to this, there's an astronomical alignment connecting specific points in the architecture. Look at how they describe the angle of shadow cast by the western minaret during the solstice."
"And my father and Malik were encoding the location of something beneath the structure,” Aya said.
"Or within it," Leyla corrected. "Süleymaniye was built on the site of older structures. There are Byzantine ruins beneath parts of it, and Ottoman architects often incorporated existing foundations."
Aya studied the security pattern once more. "It's now or never. Amina, are you good to move?"
Amina rolled her shoulder carefully. "I've worked with worse."
The cobblestones were slick as they made their way toward the mosque complex.
"Guard," Aya whispered as they reached a small maintenance gate.
They pressed against the stone wall as a flashlight beam swept past. When it vanished around the corner, Aya produced an electronic bypass and placed it against the security panel attached to the ancient gate. After a tense moment, the override engaged, and they squeezed through a gap in the gate, careful to avoid making it creak all the way open.
Inside, the mosque's courtyard was filled with an eerie nighttime calm. The main prayer hall was locked for the night, but according to Karim's analysis, they needed to access the northeastern corner of the complex.
"This way," he whispered, leading them toward a small auxiliary building. "The paper mentions 'the shadow of knowledge falls upon the waters of wisdom at midnight.' It's not poetic; it's literal. There's a small fountain structure that aligns with—"
"That," Aya finished, pointing to an unassuming marble fountain nestled against the complex's outer wall. In daylight, it would be overlooked by visitors admiring the mosque's grander features.
They crept to the fountain, and Leyla knelt beside it, analyzing the intricate carvings. "As with the cemetery, I don’t think these are just decorative patterns."
"The eight-pointed star," Aya said, studying the ancient markings. "To signal to Çelebi's followers, I suppose."
Amina kept watch, her back to them, eyes scanning for guards. "Just hurry it up. We've got about twelve minutes until the next patrol comes by, if they don’t change protocol."
Karim aligned his phone with the star pattern in the sky. "According to the paper, there should be a corresponding point exactly seven meters at bearing 247 degrees."
Aya paced off the distance, ending at what appeared to be a solid wall. "Nothing here."
Leyla joined her. "Ottoman architects built in layers." She pressed her hands against different stones, methodically testing each. On the fifth try, a stone shifted slightly. "Pressure mechanism," she said, her eyes bright with excitement. "Needs more force. Karim, come help us."
Together, the three pushed against the stone with all their weight. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a section of wall pivoted inward slightly, releasing pressure and revealing a short, narrow passage.
"No way," Karim whispered, awe overriding caution. "A hidden entrance that managed to remain undiscovered for centuries?"
"Not entirely undiscovered," Aya said. "My father and Malik found it. But I doubt they ever got here because of preexisting damage. Malik may have a better idea now, which would mean he could guess where we are."
The passage beyond was pitch black. Aya turned on her phone's flashlight, revealing rough-hewn stone steps descending into darkness. Cool air flowed upward, carrying the musty scent of dust, decay, and damp. She was transported back to Morocco in an instant, turning to Amina, fearing any reaction from the markings on her arm.
"Ten minutes," Amina warned, taking up position at the entrance without any sign of possession or pain. "I'll keep watch here. If I whistle, run back immediately."
Leyla produced a small LED lantern from her bag. "I came prepared."
The stairs descended steeply, each step worn smooth by feet that had traversed them centuries ago. After thirty steps, the passage leveled out into a small antechamber. Three archways branched in different directions.
"Which way?" Aya asked, examining the worn inscriptions above each arch.
Leyla studied the Ottoman script. "Left says 'path of stars.' Center is 'path of elements.' Right is 'path of light.'"
"Stars," Karim said immediately. "Çelebi was an astronomer first."
The left passage narrowed as they progressed, the ceiling dropping until they were forced to crouch. Then, without warning, it opened into a chamber that drew gasps from all three.
The room was circular, nearly fifteen meters across, its domed ceiling painted with constellations that glittered with a reflective pigment. Around the perimeter stood workbenches of stone and wood, their surfaces cluttered with equipment that looked untouched for centuries: glass-blowing tools, alchemical apparatus, and instruments that defied immediate identification.
"This is it," Leyla whispered, moving toward the center of the room. "Çelebi's actual workshop. And it doesn’t look like anyone’s beaten us to it."
Aya approached one of the workbenches, examining what appeared to be grinding stones, polishing instruments, and specialized clamps, all tools for lens-crafting.
Karim had already begun documenting everything with his phone. "My god, this is incredible. I’ve never discovered anything like this."
In the center of the room stood a large stone table inscribed with concentric circles and astronomical markings. Atop it rested a series of drawings on curling, brittle paper. Leyla carefully unrolled one.
"This has to be his Astral Lens," she whispered.
Karim joined her. "Yes, it's the system of lenses and reflective surfaces."
"Designed to focus and amplify energy as we guessed?" Aya asked.
Leyla moved to another bench where a star chart had been painted directly onto the stone surface. "It’s exactly as I thought, as was rumored. Cosmic energy, from deep space. Çelebi believed certain stellar alignments created energy pathways that could be captured and channeled. Look around us. This is all dedicated to harnessing the powers, still beyond our comprehension, in the universe."
"That's impossible," Karim said automatically, then caught himself. "At least, according to conventional physics."
"Conventional physics doesn't account for djinn either," Aya said. “Or some really deranged things Amina and I have found in Thailand or Bulgaria.”
While they examined the documents, Aya paced the chamber, her thief's instincts cataloging everything. On the far side, partially hidden behind a fallen shelf, she discovered what appeared to be a furnace.
"Here’s his forge. This is how he crafted the lens components," she called to the others. "Look at the design."
Karim joined her, examining the strange apparatus with growing excitement. “All just meters below those who would have executed him.”
"The Ottoman Empire was at its scientific height then," Leyla said, carefully examining glass fragments in a nearby cabinet. "The Süleymaniye complex included a hospital, observatory, and multiple madrasas. It would have been the perfect cover for Çelebi's more esoteric work, to cover the coming and going of his circle without arousing suspicion."
"So, we’re guessing the lens was created to harness energy during specific astronomical alignments. Unlimited energy drawn from the cosmos itself,” Aya said.
"Yeah, the same thing Aegis wanted from the Amulet in Morocco. I’m not seeing anything that contradicts our existing ideas," Karim said.
Leyla's face darkened. "But still no idea why they took Emre."
“Or why haven’t they killed him, or us for that matter. They need something from one of us,” Aya said.
Amina's sharp whistle cut through the conversation. Time was running short.
"We need to document everything and go," Aya said, immediately shifting to extraction mode. "Karim, photograph all the documents. Leyla, is there anything we should take with us?"
Leyla hesitated before moving to a small wooden box on one of the workbenches. She opened it carefully, revealing several glass fragments wrapped in ancient cloth. Her eyes widened. "These match the descriptions from your father's notes. The glass fragment, the primary lens element we talked about. These could be test pieces, or possibly even the actual component Çelebi hid here."
As they worked rapidly to document the workshop, Amina appeared at the chamber entrance, her expression hardened. "Didn’t you hear me? Guards changed the rotation pattern. We need to leave. Now."
"Just a minute," Karim insisted, photographing the final documents. "This could be the key to understanding the entire lens assembly. To give us an upper hand, finally."
"We don't have a minute. I can’t predict the guards’ movements anymore," Amina snapped. "Unless you want to explain to Turkish authorities why we're trespassing in a national monument, armed to the teeth."
"This is more important," Leyla countered, carefully wrapping glass fragments in cloth. "These components might be the only surviving pieces of the lens."
"More important than our freedom? Our lives?" Amina's voice rose. "We need to be smarter than we have been. We lost Abdelatif, and we barely escaped ourselves in Morocco. Then we allowed ourselves to get lulled into security in Istanbul, all while the Aegis amassed forces around us. I, for one, would not like to get ambushed again."
"We are being smart," Karim insisted. "We're being thorough."
"You don't understand what's at stake," Amina said, her eyes flashing. "I've got these marks crawling under my skin that burn every time we get close to something like this. I can feel it again. This isn't just some big historical discovery; it's dangerous."
"We know it's dangerous," Aya said, trying to defuse the situation. "That's why—"
"No, you don't know," Amina cut her off. "None of you understand what it's like to have been touched by whatever power was in that Amulet. To feel it responding to this place, right now."
"Amina," Aya warned, seeing where this was heading. “What are you feel—”
“You’re all treating this like a museum heist,” Amina said through gritted teeth. “It’s not.”
Karim, still photographing the star chart, didn’t look up. “We’re treating it like science because that’s what it is.”
“Science?” She tapped the marks, now glowing faintly beneath her sleeve as they had in the presence of djinn. “The thing in my veins is not science. Every step closer to that lens, it stirs. It wants something.”
Karim finally raised his head. “We’ll contain it.”
“You don’t get it, professor.” Her voice cracked, softer now, aimed at Aya. “Morocco nearly killed me. The only reason I stayed or even came here was…” She swallowed. “Was you, Aya. I’d follow you anywhere. Hell, I have. I’ve never stopped caring about you, and I’ll never love anyone like I loved you. And nobody in this room understands that history but us, and I know you’ve moved on. But can you listen to me, for once? I’m not one of you academics, but I have some kind of connection to these powers, and we need to get the fuck out of here, now!”
The workshop fell silent. Karim froze, his phone still raised to capture the star chart. His expression shifted from frustration to something carefully, deliberately blank.
Aya felt her chest tighten and regretted every chance she’d passed on telling Karim about her past with Amina. "I... yeah," she said finally, her voice strained with forced neutrality. She cleared her throat. "Okay. We should go."
"Okay, she's right," Karim said, suddenly businesslike. "Security is our priority. We've got what we need. We all care about each other, and our well-being should come first right now."
Amina folded her arms and stormed back out of the workshop.
The silent tension crackled as they gathered their findings and prepared to leave. Just as they were about to exit, Aya noticed something in the star chart that had been partially hidden by dust. Brushing it away, she revealed the eye within radiating lines that had appeared throughout her father's notebook.
"Wait," she said. "The Celestial Gate." The diagram in Hassan’s journal matched the central element of the lens assembly on the workbench exactly.
Before she could elaborate, Karim's phone vibrated. He glanced at the screen, his face paling. "It's Salah."
He activated the speaker. Salah's voice came through, tight with urgency. "Where are you? Tell me you're not still at the mosque."
"We're just leaving," Karim said. "Why?"
"Because I'm tracking Aegis comms and they've converged on your location," Salah said. "They know you're there, and they're moving in. Now."
The distant sound of boots on stone echoed down the passage, growing louder with each second.
Aya met Leyla's eyes, then Karim's, the recent tension momentarily forgotten in the face of immediate danger.
"Too late," Aya said. "They're already here. Grab anything that we might need."
Chapter 13
"Stand back," Leyla whispered, reaching into her bag. She produced what looked like a road flare, but smaller. "Phosphorus smoke device."
"You just happen to have that?" Karim asked.
"After they snatched Amina, yeah, I came prepared." She struck the cap against the stone. "Cover your mouths and stay close."
The device hissed to life, instantly filling the narrow passage with dense, billowing smoke. Aya pulled her shirt over her nose and mouth, gesturing for the others to follow as she led them not toward the entrance, but deeper into the passage network.
"Wrong way," Amina said through a cough.
"Trust me," Aya said. Her instincts told her Çelebi had a backup plan. "We’ll take the ‘Path of Light.’"
They stumbled through the thickening smoke, following the right-hand passageway. Behind them, shouts echoed off stone walls as their pursuers entered the workshop.
The passage narrowed, then began to slope upward. Light infiltrated the darkness, the soft, ambient glow of the mosque's exterior illumination filtering through what appeared to be a sewer drain.
"There," Aya pointed to a metal grate overhead. "Karim, boost me up."
He interlaced his fingers without comment, and Aya stepped into his hands while he lifted her toward the grate. It was old wrought-iron, corroded at its moorings. She pushed against it, feeling it give slightly.
"Amina, your knife."
Amina passed up a combat blade. Aya wedged it into the grate's edge, working it back and forth until, with a screech of protesting metal, one corner broke free. She pressed her back against the side of the opening, widening it until the entire grate shifted.
"Got it," she grunted, pushing the grate aside. Cool night air rushed in.
One by one, they hauled themselves up through the opening, emerging behind a decorative wall in the mosque's outer courtyard. They had bypassed the main security perimeter, but could see shadowy figures moving quickly across the grounds, sticking to the shadows.
“Convenient for Çelebi and his collaborators to avoid detection. Clever,” Karim said.
"Northwest corner," Leyla whispered, pointing toward a service gate. "It's our only shot."
They crouched behind ornamental planters, Aya's heart hammering against her ribs. The courtyard stretched before them, its marble surface gleaming under the ambient lighting. Between them and the perimeter wall lay fifty meters of open ground, broken only by decorative pools and geometric flower beds that would provide minimal cover. The shadows were their only hope.
"On my count," Aya whispered, watching the shadows move along the eastern colonnade. "Three... two..."
They broke from cover in unison, staying low as they sprinted toward the first marble fountain. Amina reached it first, pressing her back against its rim while scanning for threats. Leyla and Karim dove behind a raised planter.
The sound of boots on stone grew louder, more organized. Aya counted at least six sets. They had seconds before the search pattern reached their position.
She caught Amina's eye and pointed toward the next piece of cover, a larger fountain with ornate stonework. Amina nodded, then gestured to Karim and Leyla, indicating they should angle toward the maintenance building instead.
They moved in coordinated bursts, using the decorative architecture as stepping stones across the exposed space. Behind them, the search was closing in, as flashlight beams swept methodically across the courtyard, probing every shadow.
While Aya prepared for the final sprint to the perimeter wall, every floodlight blazed to full intensity. 
The courtyard erupted in harsh white light, transforming their shadows into stark silhouettes against the ancient stone, and a voice cut through the night, amplified by a handheld speaker.
"Ms. Amrani and friends. How remarkable to find you here."
Malik stood at the center of the courtyard, surrounded by at least a dozen of his soldiers. Unlike them, in full combat gear and night vision goggles, he made no pretense of concealment, dressed in a charcoal suit that absorbed the light. He held up a hand, and the closing circle of agents halted.
"I truly admire your persistence," he continued, his voice echoing off the mosque. "Hassan would be proud."
Aya assessed their tactical position, yet again counting just how outnumbered they were. Four operatives by the northwest gate. Three more were approaching from the east. The wall behind them was too high to scale quickly.
"What do you want, Malik?" Leyla demanded.
His eyes shifted to her casually. "Dr. Yilmaz. Your continued involvement remains somewhat unexpected, and I must say we underestimated you. See, Aya, we’re not some omniscient conspiracy or invisible hand. We make mistakes, too."
Leyla tensed beside Aya.
"Emre is safe," Malik said, addressing Leyla directly. "Conducting research willingly, actually, more willingly than you might think. He's brilliant enough to recognize what we're working toward. He could use your expertise as well, and I'm genuinely hoping you'll join him."
"Why should we believe anything you say?" Karim demanded.
"Because I'm not asking you to work for Aegis. I fear that no matter how truthful our claims of employment were, Philipe Léglise made that path impossible with his megalomania in Morocco. I'm asking you to work for humanity's future." Malik's voice remained calm despite the armed standoff. "The lens represents a threshold moment. Either humanity takes this evolutionary step, accepts the risks inherent in transformation, or we continue our slow slide toward extinction while pretending incremental solutions will save us. Hassan understood the stakes even if he couldn't accept them. His fear was human, but it was also a failure of courage at the moment courage mattered most."
"Like you offered my father?" Aya challenged.
Something passed across Malik's face—genuine grief, perhaps, quickly controlled. "Hassan made his choice, and I respected him too much to force his hand. I wanted him as a colleague, not a prisoner. His death was…" He paused, and for the first time, his composure cracked slightly. "His death was the universe's way of removing the man who could have helped us navigate this transition safely. Now we proceed without his wisdom, his caution, his ability to see both the power and the danger. That's the real tragedy."
While the conversation drew on, they were being systematically surrounded, but the agents were maintaining distance, clearly following orders to capture, not kill or provoke.
"I'm offering you a choice," Malik continued, his voice taking on the tone of a teacher trying to reach a stubborn student. "Join the research. Help shape how this knowledge is used. Your father's perspective, his caution, his ethical framework, and of course, his research, which I know you possess. We need his voice, his work. I'm not asking you to abandon his principles. I'm asking you to complete what he started with the wisdom he would have brought if he'd lived."
"And if we refuse?" Aya asked.
"Then you force me to proceed without you, which means without Hassan's influence, without the ethical guardrails he would have insisted on. You make the very outcome you fear more likely." Malik gestured toward the mosque. "I'd rather not leave you to the Turkish authorities for breaking into a historical monument, but I will if you make progress impossible. Some sacrifices are necessary."
Aya exchanged glances with the others. Amina's slight nod toward the decorative pool. Leyla's eyes flicked toward the scaffolding on the adjacent building. Karim's subtle shift of weight, preparing to move.
"We need a few minutes to discuss," Aya called back, playing for time.
"By all means." Malik smiled thinly. "Though I should mention that my patience, unlike my resources, is finite."
Aya turned her back to Malik, drawing her team into a tight huddle. "So, we’re obviously not cooperating with these bastards,” she whispered. “On my signal, Amina goes left toward the wall they’re still restoring, with the scaffolding. I think it’s best if Leyla and Karim go right, toward the maintenance building. I'll create a diversion and go for the gate."
"They'll catch at least one of us," Amina murmured. “I mean it won’t be me, but—”
"But they can’t catch all of us. Plus, I have a feeling they’ll go for me, and we’re completely cornered otherwise. Whoever escapes, meet at the secondary location," Aya replied. "Whoever gets free, gets help. They’re not going to kill us; none of the shots they’ve taken have been at us. They’ve been suppressive. They need something from us still, and they don’t think they can get it if we’re dead."
Karim's eyes met Aya’s, pained but resolute. "Be careful."
Aya nodded, then spoke loudly for Malik's benefit. "We need more assurances."
"Of course," Malik called back. "Perhaps if you shared what you've discovered so far as a gesture of good faith?"
“Actually,” Aya said, letting Malik see the small muslin sachet she produced. “You might like to see this up close.” 
Malik’s eyes widened at what Aya knew was a mixture of magnesium filings, fine flour, and crushed potassium nitrate. She flicked her lighter and tossed the pouch into the air. A blinding flash and whoosh of white spark shower erupted, stunning every eye for two precious seconds.
Leyla followed with a tactical smoke pellet amidst the distraction. Gray vapor flooded the portico. Cameras whited out, guards searched for targets.
The team exploded into motion. Amina vaulted over a low ornamental wall with her typical feline grace. Leyla and Karim broke right, sprinting toward the maintenance building. Aya herself charged directly at the nearest Aegis operative, catching him off guard. She ducked under his grasp, using his momentum to send him sprawling into the pool. As he fell, she attempted to wrestle his gun free, but it slipped through her hands.
Chapter 14
Chaos erupted across the courtyard. Malik barked orders as his team scrambled to intercept the fleeing group. Two agents moved to block Amina, but she was already scaling the scaffolding, ascending with ease despite her injuries. Aya had seen her in worse shape; she knew she would get free.
Aegis rifles snapped up but hesitated. The mosque's CCTV cameras hung overhead. Malik's men awaited orders. So, Aya thought, not as long a reach in Istanbul, without the US military on speed dial. But for how long?
Amina was already over the wall, disappearing into the darkness. Leyla and Karim sprinted for the maintenance building, navigating between construction materials with Karim's knowledge of the grounds.
Aya ran for the gate, legs pumping, lungs burning, her side screaming.
From the haze, Malik's voice carried clearly, remarkably calm despite the chaos: "We're not executing people on holy ground for the sake of schedules. Capture only." 
His team hesitated, clearly surprised by the order. "Sir, we can still—"
"No fatalities," Malik repeated firmly. "Hassan's daughter doesn't become a martyr in a mosque courtyard. That's not how this ends. Shut down the floodlights and pull back before authorities arrive. We have what we need from tonight."
The first shot rang out just as Aya reached the maintenance building. Leyla pulled her through the door as a rubber bullet ricocheted off the frame. Karim slammed it shut behind them, wedging a metal bar through the handles.
"It won't hold long," Leyla panted.
"It might not need to." Karim was already moving through the cluttered space, navigating between equipment and supplies. "I studied these plans for hours when we couldn’t make sense of the old measurements in Malik and Hassan’s publications. There should be a municipal access tunnel through here. Connects to the water system."
“There,” Aya called, pointing to the back wall.
There was a heavy steel door with Turkish warning signs. Leyla attacked its lock.
After a series of rattling bludgeons, the lock yielded, and Leyla pulled the door open to reveal a narrow utility tunnel lit by sparse emergency bulbs. "Move."
They plunged into the tunnel as the barricaded door behind them began ripping free from the wall under impact. The access passage stretched before them, curving away beneath the streets of Istanbul.
"What about Amina?" Karim asked as they ran.
"She knows where to go," Aya replied, confident it was true.
Water dripped steadily from pipes overhead, each drop echoing in the confined space. Their footsteps splashed through shallow puddles as they ran, the sound magnified and distorted. Behind them, shouts echoed.
"Left here," Karim gasped, pointing to a junction where another passage branched away from their route. The new tunnel was smaller, forcing them to duck as they ran. Cables and pipes lined the walls.
Following the passage as it curved upward, the sound of pursuit had faded, but Aya didn't trust the silence. The tunnel system was a maze. Their hunters could emerge anywhere, and they could hit a dead end.
After what felt like an hour but was probably fifteen minutes, they reached a maintenance shaft with a rusted ladder leading upward. City lights filtered down through a heavy grate overhead, along with the muffled sound of traffic.
“Let’s hope it’s movable,” Leyla said.
Karim climbed first, testing the grate's weight before straining to push it aside with a metallic screech. “Finally,” he said.
One by one, they hauled themselves up through the opening, emerging in a narrow alley between two residential buildings. The mosque's minarets were visible in the distance, at least six blocks away.
Aya slid the grate back before rolling two overflowing garbage cans on top of it to hopefully block the light and provide more resistance.
"Let's go," Aya urged, running around two corners before mercifully finding an empty taxi and speeding back to Leyla's safehouse.
They arrived twenty-five minutes later, exhausted and on edge. The apartment was dark and empty, with no sign of Amina.
"She'll make it," Aya said, as much to convince herself as the others. "She always does."
While Leyla re-secured the perimeter, Karim moved to the far side of the room, unpacking their findings from the mosque. An emotional barrier between them felt palpable; a sudden chasm opened by Amina's words.
Aya approached cautiously. "Karim, about what Amina said—"
"Not now," he cut her off, his voice carefully neutral. "We need to analyze these finds while they're fresh in our minds."
"We should talk about it."
"Should we?" He looked up, his expression carefully controlled. "What is there to say? You and Amina were together, and I feel like you had every opportunity in the world to tell me, and that I had a right to know. I feel like a fool. There are still a lot of feelings there, and it’s unclear where you stand now, which makes it very unclear where you stand with me."
"It isn't like that," Aya pleaded. "It was complicated, and it ended badly, long before Morocco. It’s ancient history."
"Clearly, it still matters to Amina. I… I’m not blind either." He returned to arranging the photographs from the workshop, creating deliberate distance. "But we have more important concerns right now."
Before Aya could respond, desperately trying to reassure Karim, a sharp rap on the door froze them all. Leyla drew her weapon, approaching cautiously.
"It's me, and I come alone," came Amina's voice. "Open up, I’m goddamn exhausted. Some of us had to do some actual fighting."
Leyla verified through the peephole before unbolting the door. Amina slipped inside, disheveled but unharmed.
"Lost them near the bazaar with only a few minor scuffles," she mumbled, avoiding eye contact with both Aya and Karim. "Used a couple of rooftops to create distance, then doubled back."
An uncomfortable silence descended, the team's usual post-mission relief dampened. 
Leyla busied herself brewing coffee. Aya watched her, searching for signs of anything else her new ally might be concealing.
"I need to check our new findings against my notes," Karim said, retreating to a corner with his materials.
Amina moved to the opposite side of the room, examining and cleaning her weapons with unnecessary thoroughness. Aya found herself stranded in the middle, isolated by the emotional currents flowing around her.
The fragile silence was broken by the chime of Aya's secure phone. She answered immediately and put the call on speaker.
"Hot damn, you're still alive!" Omar's voice burst through the speaker, a mixture of relief and excitement. "Mashallah, I've been trying to reach you for hours but couldn’t get a call through. Is everyone okay?"
"We're all here," Aya confirmed. "Banged up but intact. It’s good to hear from you. I assume you’ve been in regular contact with Salah?"
"Hamdulillah, and that I have," Omar said rapidly. "But listen, I’m going to jump right in. I found something in Abdelatif's study."
At the mention of their fallen friend, Aya, Karim, and Amina instinctively drew closer.
"What did you find?" Aya asked.
"Well, beyond being a sultan of underworld connections, slash king of carpets, slash trying to coordinate everything for you field-worthy assets, remember how I told you I'd continue studying his materials after you left Marrakech? Turns out there are heaps of references to an Ottoman secret society called 'Hat-ı Sükût' or the Silent Meridian. You know the old man fancied himself some kind of medjay, illuminati, protector, badass. He ate this stuff up. Well, these were dedicated to protecting scientific secrets, and there are some passing references to astronomical events."
"Like, presumably the Astral Lens?" Leyla asked.
"Exactly my guess," Omar confirmed. "But here's where it gets interesting. It looks like Abdelatif believed there was a modern incarnation of this society that endured, or at least was founded by people who discovered their archives and were taking up the mantle."
Karim looked up from his notes. "Well, I guess it could be the Aegis that he suspected. Maybe in an earlier form."
"Speaking of, there's more," Omar continued. "Salah intercepted some Aegis comms, and you're going to find this interesting." He pulled up encrypted messages on his tablet. "Aegis headquarters is furious with Malik. Listen to this: 'Subject team has had multiple opportunities for termination. Cemetery, safehouse, Süleymaniye Mosque. Recommend immediate extraction with extreme prejudice.'" Omar looked up. "That's corporate-speak for 'why haven't you killed them yet?'"
"And Malik's response?" Leyla asked, tension in her voice.
"This is where it gets interesting." Omar scrolled through the messages. "Malik told his superiors, and I'm quoting directly: 'Hassan Amrani's daughter is more valuable alive than dead. Her group is solving archaeological puzzles that our entire research division couldn't crack in three months. The team has located two workshop sites, decoded multiple ciphers, and is consistently one step ahead of our intelligence. I propose a strategy of allowing them to work unimpeded, maintaining surveillance, then negotiating a partnership at critical junctures. Living ones can be persuaded.'"
The words hung in the air.
"More than that," Omar continued, reading further. "There's this bit: 'Hassan's daughter inherited his brilliance. She can be convinced. Every confrontation is a recruitment opportunity. Patience required.' Then his superior's response: 'Patience expired. Terminate if non-compliant.' And Malik's final message: 'Recommendation noted. Will proceed with the current strategy until components are secured. If his daughter is half as capable, she's worth the patience.'"
“That would be why they coordinated with police and weren’t willing to start a massive firefight,” Aya said. “He thinks I’ll turn, be on his side.”
"Basically good news, I think. I do love my friends not getting shot at any more than necessary," Omar confirmed. "But after a while, that kind of pressure might make him more dangerous. A cornered scorpion strikes hardest, you know?"
"What do we know about this Silent Meridian?" Karim asked.
Aya’s mind shot to Malik. Her father. A new generation of Hat-ı Sükût.
"From the little I could find in Abdel’s study, they first formed during Suleiman the Magnificent's reign," Omar said. "Originally, astronomers and mathematicians within the Ottoman court were delving into new approaches to astronomy, and they wanted to learn as much as they could."
"Çelebi was likely a member?" Leyla asked.
"Almost certainly," Omar said. "The society operated in plain sight for decades, then went underground after Sultan Murad III destroyed Taqi al-Din's observatory in 1580. Allegedly, they continued in secret, preserving their knowledge through coded messages, hidden workshops, and secret society rituals. Think freemason type stuff."
"Like the hidden workshop we just found," Amina said.
"That sounds like it would tick the boxes, my fair lady. But, this is the big boy," Omar's voice lowered. "Check Abdelatif's journal, the one you brought from Morocco that had some of the first references we found. This may be crazy, but I have reason to believe there's a hidden pocket in the binding.”
Aya’s eyes darted to her bag, with the journal inside. It was a similar tactic her father had used.
“Abdelatif was a weird geezer, you remember,” Omar said. “Always stitched his own journals. Hand‑sewn, wax‑thread, proper bookbinder’s knots. That crimson one? It never left his side. Not in the desert, not at market, not even when he slept.”
“Maybe.” Aya retrieved the battered journal from her bag. She'd carried it since leaving Morocco, a tangible connection to their fallen friend, along with her dad’s journals. Running her fingers along the leather binding.
“And I remembered an old job,” Omar continued. “Back when we were running a small smuggling operation through Tangier customs, he showed me a trick: slit the spine of a hardcover book, hide the forged manifesto, stitch it closed again. It could be a long shot, but ever since that memory came back to me, the more I believe there had to be a reason he clung to that dusty old thing."
“Here,” Aya murmured. She took out her knife and slid the blade beneath the inner hinge, teasing apart a row of whip-stitches. Threads snapped one by one; the leather separated, revealing a narrow cavity in the spine’s hollow.
Inside lay a thin, narrow, tissue-wrapped object. She drew it out delicately, the book’s covers closing again with a hollow clap, as though they’d exhaled a secret kept far too long.
"What is it?" Karim asked.
Aya unwrapped the tissue paper carefully. Inside lay a small fragment of glass or crystal, its surface etched with microscopic patterns.
"It’s impossible. It looks like a piece of the lens," she breathed. "But how could Abdelatif have had it?"
Karim leaned closer, examining the fragment under the lamplight. "Wait. Look at the edges. No weathering, no oxidation. This isn't four hundred years old." He turned it carefully. "The craftsmanship matches Çelebi's designs, but the glass itself... this was made recently. Within the last few decades, maybe less."
"Abdelatif made it himself?" Amina asked.
"Or had it made." Aya pulled out her father's notebook, flipping to a section she'd glossed over. Dense technical annotations about material compositions and fabrication techniques. "Here. My father wrote about this. 'Several secondary components can be reproduced given precise specifications and appropriate materials. The calibration rings, focusing tubes, and stabilization elements are technically achievable with modern glassmaking. However, others possess properties that cannot be replicated, including specific mineral compositions found only in the original artifacts."
"So some pieces can be recreated," Leyla said slowly, "but not all of them."
“Based on my father’s work a generation ago,” Aya said. “So even that could be outdated.”
"Which means we have no way of knowing which components Aegis has already manufactured," Karim finished. "They could have half the assembly ready. They might only need an irreplaceable piece or two."
"The crown lens," Aya said. "My father's notes called it the control mechanism. If that's one of the pieces that can't be recreated..."
"Then that's what they're really hunting," Amina concluded.
"I’m speechless. Abdelatif never mentioned this to me." Omar said.
"Me neither," Aya said. "Where did he get it? When did he get it?"
"His family collected old trinkets, relics, whatever, for generations. That’s why he was so interested in antiquities and historical mysteries. He might not have known its significance. But why hide it like this?"
Amina approached cautiously. "May I see it?"
Aya held out the delicate sliver. As Amina's fingers touched the glass, the fragment began to glow with a soft light that radiated the colors of the entire color spectrum. Simultaneously, the faded markings on Amina's arm flared with the same luminescence.
Amina gasped, nearly dropping the fragment. "Fuck. It... it recognizes me. What does this mean?"
The glass continued to pulse in her palm, casting luminous reflections across the safehouse walls. The team stared in stunned silence as the alchemical glass responded to the supernatural energy still lingering within Amina's body.
"It’s like the djinn," Karim whispered. "The lens is somehow connected to the same power."
“Sure would be great if Abdelatif was still with us to tell me what the hell is going on.”
Through the phone, Omar's voice was barely audible. "What's happening?"
No one answered. They were transfixed by the glowing fragment and the implications of its response to Amina's touch, a bridge between the cosmic science of Ottoman alchemists and something similar to the supernatural forces they had confronted in the Atlas Mountains.
The fragment's light intensified, casting Amina's face in an eerie glow as the markings on her arm pulsed in perfect synchronization.
Chapter 15
The fragment of glass shimmered with increasing intensity. Amina's arm trembled as the markings responded, lines glowing beneath her skin like living calligraphy, no longer resembling Amazigh symbols but taking on thin lines connecting fixed points and forming geometric patterns. A map of the night sky.
"Someone take this," Amina gasped, holding out the crystal shard.
Karim carefully plucked it from her palm with a cloth from his archaeology kit. The glow dimmed immediately, though it didn't extinguish completely.
Examining the fragment, he said, "Well, I think it’s obvious, but it's responding to whatever residual energy remains in Amina's markings from the djinn encounter."
"Energy transference," Leyla breathed, leaning closer. "Maybe Çelebi didn't just create a lens to focus cosmic radiation. He could have created a system to harness energy from other dimensional planes."
Through the phone, Omar's voice crackled. "Did you say dimensional planes?"
"I’m thinking of it like tuning a radio," Karim said, setting the fragment on a clean sheet of paper. "The djinn exist in a parallel dimension that occasionally intersects with ours. The Amulet of Idris in Morocco was designed to open a doorway that we were able to close. This lens..." He gestured to the pulsing crystal. "I don’t know, maybe this could create a permanent channel instead of a doorway."
Amina rubbed her arm, the markings now faded back to look like typical tattoos. "I can feel it. Like it's trying to communicate."
Aya approached her cautiously. "Are you okay?"
"It doesn't hurt," Amina said, avoiding Aya's eyes. "It feels... familiar. Like in the Atlas Mountains, but more controlled. Directed. Lighter. And no headaches or anything."
Karim photographed the fragment from multiple angles, then compared the images to the workshop blueprints they'd discovered. "This might match one of the smaller components in Çelebi's designs. There are at least six major pieces needed to realize his plans, possibly more."
"Deliberately separated, it would seem," Leyla said, "to prevent misuse."
"Omar," Aya addressed the phone, "did Abdelatif’s notes mention where other components might be?"
"No," Omar replied. "Nothing like that. But I’d start with places connected to the Silent Meridian. Though I understand hunting down the secret hiding places used by a secret, hidden organization may be a little tricky.”
“What about this symbol we keep seeing?” Karim pulled up their photographs of Çelebi's workshop on his tablet, indicating a symbol etched into one of the lens casings. "Look at this marking. It appears on several components, but it doesn’t have anything in common with the celestial imagery that appears on the glass or in Çelebi’s work."
"It’s a merchant's mark," Leyla identified immediately. "Ottoman traders used these to identify their goods.”
Leyla frowned and snapped a close-up of the symbol with her phone. 
“Give me a minute. I have a copy of an old guild registry.” 
She flung open her laptop as they crowded around and watched her search through a folder of her doctoral research, then scroll through a carousel of Ottoman trade sigils, then brightened. 
“Here. Match confirmed.” She rotated the screen for them: the same crescent-and-loop emblem beside a terse line of Ottoman Turkish. “Kapanizade. Imperial glassmakers, chartered 1703, but family workshop documented in Kadıköy since 1590.” 
She lifted the screen beside the etched mark. Perfect overlay. “So if any descendants kept fragments of Çelebi’s work, odds are good they’re in the shop or stashed in their storeroom.” 
"Do they still exist?" Aya asked.
"The family name persists," Leyla confirmed. "According to Google, there’s a Kapanizade antique shop here in Kadıköy. It’s over 100 years old, family owned.”
A fragile excitement built in the room.
"We should go first thing tomorrow," Karim said.
"We need to go mid-morning. It’s Saturday, so there’ll be a market," Aya countered. "Malik will be watching known historical sites, and an antique market may qualify. It’s a stretch, but we’ll need to be safe and try to use the market as a bit of cover—crowds, multiple exits, disguises. Mid-morning will be busiest."
“Then we rest for now,” Leyla decided. “You’re right, dawn’s too quiet. We hit the bazaar mid-morning, shoulder-to-shoulder with tourists. Crowds are cover.” 
Karim nodded, exhaustion finally registering. “Four hours’ sleep, then rotate watch. Amina, you can take the full night of sleep. We’ll cover you."
"I'm fine," Amina insisted, though her fingers still traced the markings on her arm. "This isn’t like what happened in Morocco."
"If that fragment reacts to Amina's markings," Omar said through the speaker, "the other components might do the same. It could help locate them.”
"We'll keep you updated, Omar," Aya promised. “Good work.”
"Be careful," Omar said.
The call ended, leaving them in tense silence as they gathered supplies and weapons, preparing to reenter the chase in the morning.
"Ready?" Aya asked when they'd finished.
Three nods, no words.


"There," Aya pointed toward a narrow side street branching from the main bazaar. "Kapanizade Antiques is on the corner."
Shoppers flowed between stalls, voices rising in a cacophony of haggling and conversation. Spice merchants competed with textile vendors, their colorful wares creating a kaleidoscope effect beneath canvas awnings.
They moved through the crowd as two pairs, Aya with Karim and Leyla with Amina, maintaining casual separation while keeping visual contact. Aya was pleased at how naturally Karim played his role, despite the new strain between them. His arm draped loosely over her shoulder, the perfect image of a tourist couple exploring Istanbul's markets, though his touch felt mechanical now, performance rather than affection.
"Eleven o'clock by the guys selling records," Aya said. She had spotted the man without turning her head: cropped hair, rigid posture, scanning rather than shopping. Aegis.
"They're already here," Karim said quietly. His hand tightened slightly on her shoulder. "How?"
"I guess they're trying to watch the entire area around the clock."
"There's another twenty meters ahead. Let's abort," Amina’s voice came through their own earpieces. "Too exposed."
"No," Aya countered. "The crowd works in our favor. Let’s head to the shop, but stagger the rest of the way, and each be ready to run if we need to."
They continued through the market, adopting the meandering pace of tourists.
Kapanizade Antiques occupied a pristine building with ornate wooden trim. The display behind the window featured intricately etched glassware that caught the morning light, casting prismatic light across the cobblestones.
"Ready?" Aya asked.
"Go," Leyla confirmed from her position thirty meters away. “We’ll hang for a few and be right behind you.”
Aya and Karim entered, a small bell announcing their arrival. The shop was a treasure trove of artifacts: ornate brass astrolabes hung alongside mother-of-pearl inlaid mirrors, while glass cases displayed everything from antique jewelry to ceramic tiles bearing calligraphy. Vintage carpets covered portions of the floor, and shelves lined the walls with books, manuscripts, and scientific instruments from centuries past.
An elderly man looked up from behind a counter crowded with pocket watches and compass roses, his face deeply lined around sharp eyes.
"Hoş geldiniz," he greeted. "Welcome."
"Thank you," Aya replied with an exaggerated smile. "Your collection is beautiful."
"Five generations of my family’s craftsmanship in this very shop. Much more before that," the man replied in accented English. "Please, browse at your leisure and let me know what it is I can help you with."
Leyla and Amina entered moments later, pretending not to know Aya and Karim as they moved to the opposite side of the shop. The old shopkeeper watched them with polite interest.
"We're interested in antique scientific instruments," Karim said casually. "I understand your family once supplied the Ottoman imperial observatory."
The shopkeeper's expression shifted subtly. "Well. You are a student of history?"
"An archaeologist, actually. Researching Hazarfen Çelebi's work."
At the mention of Çelebi, the shopkeeper's demeanor changed entirely. He straightened, eyes darting between his customers and the street beyond.
"I think you should leave," he said quietly.
"Sir, we just want to—"
"Others have come asking these questions," the man interrupted. "And each time, bad things followed. I cannot help you."
"Who?" Aya asked, abandoning pretense.
The shopkeeper hesitated, then sighed. "A few men, just the other day. Very insistent. Claimed I was in extreme danger. They claimed to represent a historical foundation. They asked odd questions. I could not help them, and the next morning, my shop’s window had a brick thrown through it. Covered in blood."
"When?" Leyla asked urgently, joining them.
"Two days ago. I just had the glass replaced yesterday. They left only a card and said to call if anyone inquired about… certain items." His gaze hardened. "I don't know what trouble surrounds these artifacts, but I want no part of it. I won’t tell them you came, but you need to leave."
Amina approached, rolling up her sleeve to reveal the markings. "Do you know anything about this?"
The shopkeeper recoiled slightly, then studied the marks with growing wonder. "The signs of djinn," he whispered. "Is this a tattoo? But why? How did you—"
"It's complicated," Amina cut him off. "Please, we need to find Çelebi's work before those men do. I know you don’t want anything bad to happen, but they’re the bad things, and if we don’t stop them, then they’ll happen to all of us."
The old man nodded slowly, looking at them each in turn before seeming to reach a decision. "Wait here."
He disappeared into a back room, returning moments later with a leather roll. He spread it across the counter, revealing what appeared to be repair tools for delicate glass instruments.
"These belonged to my great-great-grandfather," he said, his voice cracking slightly. "He served the last Ottoman masters of astral science. The tools themselves are ordinary, but this—" He indicated an unassuming brass cylinder among the implements. "This is something else."
As he spoke, Amina's markings began to tingle. "That's it," she confirmed. "I can weirdly feel it."
The shopkeeper nodded grimly. "Take it and go. Quickly."
Karim reached for the cylinder, but Aya caught his wrist. "How much?"
"No payment," the shopkeeper insisted. "Just promise you won't return to this shop or tell anyone where you got it. The men who came—I don’t want any trouble."
Aya nodded. "Thank you."
Karim carefully pocketed the cylinder, but before they could leave, Leyla glanced out the window and tensed. "We've got company."
Outside, three men were converging on the shop from different directions, but moving casually. Leyla ran to the door and engaged the deadbolt.
"Is there a back exit?" Aya asked the shopkeeper.
Under the shop’s warm lamplight, the old man’s shoulders sagged, and the proud façade slipped, revealing a tremor in the hand smoothing his waistcoat. His eyes searched each of their faces as though memorizing them.
Finally, he nodded. "Through the storeroom. It opens to the alley behind."
"Thank you," Aya said, already moving. "Lock the doors after we leave. You can say we threatened you with a knife, if you need to."
They raced through the storeroom, and its bolt thudded home behind them. They threaded a claustrophobic passage stacked with moth-chewed carpets, shouldered open a warped delivery hatch, and spilled into a back alley of garbage cans and stray cats.
Amina spoke as soon as they emerged. "Leyla and I will head north toward the ferry terminal. Karim and Aya, draw them east. All rendezvous at the secondary location in one hour."
"Take this," Karim said, handing the brass cylinder to Amina. "It's responding to you, and who knows what it’s for. Plus, they’ll probably come after us if they have to choose. You'll keep it safer."
Amina nodded, accepting the object without comment. Then they separated, moving in opposite directions down the alley.
Aya and Karim turned, pushing back through the morning market crowd with purposeful strides. They hadn’t gone more than fifty meters when Aya spotted the first man, wearing a leather jacket, sunglasses, and moving with predatory focus.
They increased their pace, weaving between stalls. The bazaar's labyrinthine layout offered temporary advantage, but also limited their exit options. Each turn revealed more potential pursuers, some openly pushing through crowds, others maintaining strategic positions at intersections.
"It feels like they're herding us," Aya said as another avenue yielded another muscular, nondescript man walking toward them, alone. "They’re forcing us toward the eastern exit."
"Then we don't go east," Karim said. "This way’s open."
They ducked into a diagonal alley, emerging into a quieter section of the market dedicated to textiles. Rolls of silk and cotton created a colorful maze of merchandise. Aya guided Karim between displays, using the fabric panels as cover.
The respite lasted seconds. A voice crackled over the market's public address system with an announcement in Turkish that caused shoppers to glance around with sudden suspicion, alarm.
"What are they saying?" Aya asked, catching the shift in atmosphere.
"I think they're describing us," Karim tried to translate, expression darkening. "Something about terrorism. Money. A reward, maybe."
"Shit," Aya realized. "Malik’s smart."
A man shopping with his two children pulled them close and began pointing at Aya, who turned to move forward quickly. The shopkeeper to their left pulled out his phone and began recording them, forcing Aya to pull her scarf around her face. 
The crowd that had been their cover transformed into an obstacle, hundreds of potential civilian informants surrounding them.
"New plan," Aya decided, pulling Karim. "Up. We just need to get a block or two away. Even if we have to fight our way out, we need to do it away from this crowd."
The corridor led to a maintenance staircase. They ascended rapidly, emerging onto the rooftop of the market building. The flat expanse stretched before them, connecting several structures in the bazaar complex.
"The cylinder," Aya said as they ran across the rooftop. "Did you see anything unusual about it?"
"It's engraved with the same patterns as the fragment," Karim replied, keeping pace. "I think it's a focusing tube, designed to channel energy between lens components, like the shaft of a telescope."
They reached the edge of the current building, facing a gap of nearly two meters to the next roof. Without hesitation, Aya backed up several steps, then sprinted forward and leaped across. She landed with practiced grace, turning to see Karim prepare for his jump.
As he landed beside her, the rooftop access door behind them burst open. Two men emerged along with a police officer.
"Durun!" the officer shouted. "Stop!"
"Keep moving!" Aya urged, pulling Karim toward the far side of the building.
They raced across the rooftop as a bullet pinged against the ventilation pipes behind them. There was a fire escape, rusted but intact, that could return them to street level.
Aya swung over the edge first, descending rapidly, while more bullets pinged off the dilapidated railings. 
Halfway down, the metal groaned ominously beneath her weight. She jumped the remaining distance, landing in a controlled roll on the cobblestones below.
"Hurry!" she called up to Karim.
He was three meters from the ground when a support bolt sheared away with a sharp crack. The entire fire escape lurched sideways, metal screaming against brick as aged mortar crumbled.
"Jump!" Aya shouted, positioning herself beneath him.
Karim pushed off from the collapsing structure, but his trajectory was wrong. Too far left, too fast. Their bodies collided, and they were sent sprawling across the uneven cobblestones.
The impact drove the breath from her lungs. Karim's elbow caught her in the ribs as they went down, and something sharp raked across her side as she rolled. The fire escape crashed down behind them in a cascade of rusted metal and masonry dust.
For a moment, they lay tangled together, both stunned. Aya felt warmth spreading along her ribs, but the adrenaline masked the pain.
"You okay?" Karim asked, helping her up with shaking hands. Dust covered his hair and clothes.
"Fine," she lied, pressing a hand to her side. When she pulled it away, her palm was slick with blood that looked black in the alley's shadows.
They hurried through a series of increasingly narrow alleys, the sounds of pursuit fading behind them. Istanbul's ancient streets once again became a maze of twisting passages and sudden dead ends, but they knew there were eyes everywhere. 
Twice, they had to backtrack until finally, in a quiet alley lined with overflowing garbage bins, they paused to catch their breath. The pain in Aya's side had intensified to a throbbing ache.
"Let me see," Karim insisted, noticing her discomfort.
"It's nothing," she protested.
"Aya."
She relented, lifting her shirt to reveal her bare torso, a jagged gash along her ribs just beneath her bra.
"Must have happened when the fire escape collapsed. I didn’t feel it at first," she said as he examined the wound.
"We need to clean and bandage this. It’ll need stitches," Karim said. He pulled a single alcohol wipe and bandage from his bag.
"I'm no field medic, but after what happened to Salah at the base, I vowed to always be slightly more prepared. This should hold until we reach the safehouse," he said, securing the bandage. 
His fingers grazed her skin, and he looked up. He left his full hand on her side, holding her while they had locked eye contact.
"Thank you," Aya said so softly that it was almost a whisper.
A slow clap echoed in the alley, and they turned to find Malik standing at the entrance, alone and apparently unarmed.
"Touching," he said, ceasing his applause. "Though I must say, you're making my job unnecessarily difficult."
Aya reached for her weapon, but Malik raised his hands in a placating gesture.
"I'm alone," he said. "And here to talk, not fight."
"What do you want?" Karim demanded, positioning himself slightly in front of Aya.
"I came without my team, not as the face of the Aegis, but as one person to another. To make a final appeal and deliver a final warning." Malik's gaze fixed on Aya. "You’re winning, that’s great, but it’s narrow. How long can it hold? And even if it does, your father died because he found the truth, Aya. Do you really want to follow him?"
Chapter 16
"What truth?" Aya asked through gritted teeth, her voice steady despite the throbbing pain in her side. "What exactly did my father discover?"
Malik moved into the alley, maintaining distance. He looked different, his suit jacket missing, shirt collar open, a faint stubble darkening his jaw.
"Hassan discovered what the Ottomans had truly built," he said. "Not just a lens to observe cosmic phenomena, but a key that could unlock forces beyond comprehension."
"We've heard this sales pitch many times before," Karim replied. "Unlimited power, reshape the future for the better, et cetera."
Malik's smile was thin. "That's the simplified version we tell our investors. The reality is more complicated." He leaned against the alley wall, eyes never leaving Aya's, and for a moment, something in his expression softened.
"Your father and I were colleagues first, friends second. We spent three summers working together at various sites. Damascus, Cairo, Istanbul. In the summer of 2008, we were in his Berkeley office at two in the morning. He'd been translating Çelebi's notes for sixteen hours straight, subsisting on terrible coffee and determination. 
“When he found the passage describing the lens, his hands were shaking. Not with fear, with pure joy. He looked at me with this expression, like a child discovering magic is real, and said, 'Malik, we might be holding proof that human consciousness can interface with cosmic energy. That every ancient text about divine power might be describing actual physics we've forgotten.' We stayed up until dawn working through implications, building frameworks, planning research."
The warmth faded from his voice, replaced by something harder. "That was Hassan at his best. Curious, brilliant, unafraid. Before the fear took over and destroyed everything we'd built."
"If you were such friends," Aya countered, "why are you hunting his daughter?"
"Because you have what we need to complete his work, and I don’t want to harm you, but I can’t hold the Aegis back much longer. After this meeting, the guns will be aimed to kill. I want to finish his work together, as he would have wanted."
"His work or yours?" Karim asked.
Malik's expression hardened. "The distinction became irrelevant when he abandoned our research without warning. Nearly ten years of collaborative effort disappeared overnight along with crucial findings."
"He had his reasons," Aya said, though uncertainty flickered across her face. How much did she truly know about her father's final projects?
"Indeed, he did." Malik pushed away from the wall, taking a step closer. "Hassan discovered something that frightened him. Something about the lens that made him decide it should remain lost. I don’t know what it was, but I believe his fear was misplaced."
"Why?" Karim demanded.
"Because I've seen what the lens components can do even in isolation," Malik said. "The energy they channel doesn't need to be inherently destructive. It's transformative." He fixed his gaze on Aya. "Your father was a brilliant archaeologist and scientist, but conservative in his thinking. He couldn't see past the lens's potential for misuse to recognize its possibilities for transcendence. Humanity doesn't have the luxury of safety anymore. Not with climate collapse accelerating, not with resources depleting, not with conventional solutions failing. We either evolve or we die. That's the choice Hassan couldn't make."
Aya's jaw tightened. "So, you're the visionary, and he was the coward? That's your perspective? And that’s meant to win me over?"
"Your father was no coward," Malik replied sharply. "He was cautious. Principled. He believed some discoveries should remain theoretical. I respect that position, but I don't share it; I see more nuance. That's why I'm offering this moment of truth between us." He spread his hands. "Cooperate willingly. Join our research team. Honor your father's brilliance by completing what he began."
"What he abandoned," Aya corrected.
"What he thought he needed to protect the world from," Karim added.
Malik's expression hung somber. "You sound just like him. The same certainty, the same conviction that caution equals wisdom." He straightened, adjusting his cuffs. "Perhaps you should know the full truth about Colombia, about what Hassan discovered that made him run."
Aya stiffened. "What about Colombia?"
"Your father's last excavation, his accident, his demise. The official report stated a collapse due to rushed safety precautions in the unpredictable chambers." Malik's voice softened. "But that's not entirely accurate."
"You weren't there," Aya said, but uncertainty crept into her voice.
"No, but I received his final message." Malik withdrew his phone, tapped the screen several times, then turned it toward them. "He sent this the night before his death."
The screen showed an email, date-stamped with September 19th, 2018. The day before Aya received the call that had changed her life. 
The sender was Hassan Amrani’s UC Berkeley email, the message brief but clear: Found a connection reading last night between a Khmer observatory and the Ottoman techniques. Same principles, working independently. The implications are staggering. Have to bury this. All of it. Call me urgently.
Aya hesitated. "This proves nothing. And emails can be faked.”
"It proves he found something significant," Malik replied. "Something that connected civilizations across time and continents. The lens wasn't an Ottoman anomaly; it was one manifestation of a universal principle."
"If that message is real," Karim interjected, "it suggests he wanted to stop the research, not continue it."
"An emotional reaction to a profound discovery," Malik said. "He deserved the chance to process it properly. To make an informed decision." He shook his head. "A chance he never got."
"Because of the accident," Aya said, the accusation clear in her tone.
Before Malik could respond, the distant wail of police sirens cut through the morning air, growing louder by the second.
"That's not my team," he said, suddenly alert. "Local police. Someone must have reported your position."
Karim moved protectively closer to Aya. "Convenient timing for your heart-to-heart to end."
"Believe what you will." Malik checked his watch, then the alley entrance. "But we all need to leave. Now."
The sirens grew closer. Malik hesitated, then made a decision. "Go," he said, gesturing toward the opposite end of the alley. "I'll delay them."
"Why would you help us?" Aya demanded.
"Because I doubt deported people can help me find the remaining lens components," he said. "And because—" He paused, something almost human crossing his stoic features. "Because Hassan would have done the same for me, once."
Seconds later, the screech of tires at the alley entrance cut off any response Aya might have made. A police vehicle blocked the opening, its lights casting rotating blue patterns across the grimy walls.
"Go," Malik ordered again, turning toward the police car and raising his hands in a disarming gesture. "Official business," they heard him call out as he produced an ID from his pocket. "Intelligence operation, need assistance tracking suspects..."
Aya and Karim bolted toward the opposite end of the alley; Aya's injured side was putting up a fight. The narrow passage curved sharply before opening onto another street.
The vehicle was just turning the corner when a black sedan screeched to a halt beside them, its passenger door flying open.
"Get in!" Leyla shouted from behind the wheel.
They dove into the car, Karim pulling the door shut as Leyla accelerated away from the sound of police sirens. The sedan's engine growled as she pushed it through the gears, taking the next corner hard, pressing them against the door panels.
"Amina?" Aya asked, glancing at the empty back seat.
"Already at the new location," Leyla said, eyes fixed on the road as she navigated a series of rapid turns. "She made it to the ferry terminal with the artifact."
"New location?" Karim asked.
"Had to abandon the safehouse," Leyla said, turning down a one-way street to evade a police car that roared past. "Too compromised."
"Where did you learn to drive like this?" Karim asked as she threaded the sedan between two delivery trucks with centimeters to spare.
"MİT defensive driving course," she said absently, then caught herself. "Long story."
Twenty minutes of evasive maneuvering later, they emerged onto the coastal road, blending with regular traffic. No pursuit vehicles visible, no sirens in the distance, just another car among thousands.
"How bad is it?" she asked, glancing at Aya's bloodstained shirt.
"Manageable," Aya said, though the bleeding had intensified during their escape. "How did you find us?"
"Tracked your burner phones," Leyla said. "Triangulated your position when you stopped moving for more than two minutes. Probably a good idea to ditch those now, too.”
She guided the sedan away from the coast, climbing into a residential district of modern apartment blocks interspersed with older villas. Eventually, she turned into an underground parking garage beneath a newer building, using a keycard to access the secure area.
"Floor sixteen," she said as they entered the elevator. "Apartment 1602."
The new apartment was smaller than the previous one, but with better security: electronic locks, modern fixtures, and panoramic windows offering clear views of surrounding streets. Amina was waiting, the brass cylinder and glass fragment laid out on the dining table alongside a street vendor's lunch spread.
"Thought you might be hungry," she said by way of greeting. Then she noticed the blood. "Oh shit. Let me see."
Aya submitted to Amina's examination, wincing as she peeled back Karim's makeshift bandage. "First aid kit?" Amina asked.
"Bathroom cabinet," Leyla called, securing the door behind them.
While Leyla and Karim examined the artifact, Amina led Aya into the bathroom.
"This is going to hurt," Amina warned, threading a curved needle from the first aid kit. "But it needs proper stitches, or it'll keep bleeding."
Aya sat on the edge of the bathroom counter, her shirt discarded, trying not to flinch as Amina cleaned the wound with antiseptic. The alcohol burned, but Amina's touch was gentle, her fingers steady despite the tremor Aya noticed in her hands.
"Hold still," Amina whispered, leaning closer. "This first one's always the worst."
The needle pierced her skin, and Aya sucked in a sharp breath. Amina's free hand instinctively moved to Aya's thigh, a steadying presence.
"Sorry," Amina whispered, not moving her hand away. "Almost done."
As she worked, Aya found herself studying the concentration etched in the lines around Amina’s eyes, the way she bit her lower lip when focusing. This close, Aya could see the faint scar above Amina's eyebrow from their escape from an underground bar in Bulgaria, and could smell the familiar scent of almond on her hair.
"There," Amina said softly, tying off the final suture. Her fingers lingered on Aya's skin as she applied the bandage, hands steadier after the precision work. "That should hold."
Their eyes met and held. For a moment, the bathroom grew impossibly small, charged with old memories, unresolved tension, and an increasing awareness that she was still topless.
"Thank you," Aya said, her voice barely above a whisper.
Amina's hand was still on her thigh. "I meant what I said at the mosque. About following you anywhere." She paused, vulnerability flickering across her features. "I know things are complicated with Karim, but—"
"Amina—" Aya began.
"I know." Amina stepped back, the spell broken. "I just needed you to know."
As they reentered the dining room, Karim looked up from his examination. "You should tell them what Malik said."
Aya nodded and recounted their conversation, including the revelation about her father's final message from Colombia. "Classic manipulation."
"But the email could be genuine," Karim pointed out gently. "It matches what you’ve said of your father's movements before his death."
"Even if it is," Aya said, "all it proves is that he found something significant enough to reconsider his research. Not that he'd want Aegis to have it. And even if Malik is better than the others in the organization, he’s still in the organization. He reports to them."
"Agreed," Leyla said, spreading out photographs they’d taken and printed from the mosque workshop across the table. "But it raises an important question: what did Hassan discover that connected Khmer observatories to Ottoman technology?"
"Cultural cross-pollination isn't uncommon," Karim noted with a shrug. "Separate civilizations often develop similar solutions to universal problems."
"But we're not talking about pyramids, agriculture, irrigation, or simple architectural similarities," Leyla argued. "The lens technology appears to be based on understanding cosmic principles that modern science hasn’t explored."
Amina leaned forward, studying the workshop photos. "Maybe it's not about cultural exchange. Maybe it's about the same natural phenomena being observed independently."
"Like convergent evolution," Karim said, nodding appreciatively at Amina's insight. "Different species developing similar traits in response to similar environmental pressures."
"Different cultures developing similar technologies in response to the same cosmic phenomena," Aya elaborated. "But that still doesn't explain where Çelebi obtained his advanced understanding."
Leyla pulled up one of the workshop photographs on her laptop. It showed a partial map, etched into the workshop wall. "We might have a clue. Look at this."
The map showed central Anatolia, with particular focus on a region labeled in Ottoman script.
"Cappadocia," Karim translated. "The area with those famous rock formations and underground cities, where tourists go for balloon rides."
"Not just any underground cities," Leyla said. "Some of the most extensive subterranean complexes in the world."
"I read somewhere they extend over twenty levels deep," Karim added, pulling up information on his phone. "And according to this, most chambers have never been properly explored. Still sealed."
"Perfect for hiding something," Amina said.
"What's the connection to Çelebi?" Aya asked.
Leyla pulled up additional images on her tablet. "Beyond the map he had in his workshop, according to historical records, Çelebi wasn't originally from Istanbul. He came from a small village near Cappadocia and only later moved to the capital to join the imperial observatory."
She zoomed in on the workshop map, highlighting markings around specific sites in the Cappadocian region. "These symbols, they could be coordinates.”
Aya leaned closer. Having grown up watching her father work, she recognized the system immediately. "These are archaeological reference points. Marking specific subterranean chambers within the underground network."
"Okay," Leyla said. "So, Çelebi tested his lens prototype in Istanbul, but maybe he hid the complete blueprints and components in Cappadocia's underground city. It was his homeland, removed from imperial oversight, famous for being impenetrable. Perfect for concealing his most advanced work."
"The underground cities were originally built for protection from invaders," Karim added. "Some date back to the Bronze Age, but were expanded over millennia. Early Christians used them to hide from Roman persecution. It would be incredibly secure, and still largely unexplored."
"Well, it sounds like Çelebi repurposed them to hide something that needed to stay hidden," Amina said.
Aya studied the markings more carefully, comparing them with a modern map. "These markings indicate a specific district, Göreme. And these numbers correspond to a depth measure. He was mapping something at least seven levels below the surface."
Karim met her eyes briefly, impressed, a momentary bridge across the growing emotional chasm between them that extended back to their first days working side-by-side.
"So we go to Cappadocia," Amina stated, breaking the moment. "Find the underground chamber, locate the remaining lens components, and put an end to this shit."
"Not so simple," Leyla said. "Cappadocia has hundreds of chambers across thousands of square kilometers. These markers narrow it down, but we're still searching a massive area. We need something more precise."
"Maybe we already have them," Aya suggested, turning to the artifacts. "These components seem to be more than just parts of the lens. Maybe they're keys, designed to lead to the next piece. And, Amina’s a walking artifact detector."
Karim carefully lifted the glass fragment from its box. "The fragment responded to Amina's markings from the Amulet. You think it can provide more specific guidance?"
Amina extended her hand. "Let me try something."
Karim passed her the fragment, and Amina walked to the window, angling the lens to the stars. As before, it began to glow upon contact with her skin, the planisphere markings on her arm responding with a matching luminescence. But this time, something new happened. The fragment's light intensified, projecting patterns across the apartment walls.
"What's happening?" Leyla gasped.
"It's reacting to the night," Amina said, her voice strained. "To the stars becoming visible. What does that mean?"
The projected light coalesced into distinct patterns, projected symbols, and scripts that shifted and flowed across the walls like living calligraphy. As they watched, transfixed, the patterns resolved into recognizable words.
Karim stepped closer, reading aloud: "Taş çiçeklerin altında beni bul."
"What does it mean?" Aya asked.
"'Find me beneath the stone flowers,'" Leyla translated, her voice thick with wonder.
"Stone flowers," Karim whispered. "That's what locals call Cappadocia's fairy chimneys—the cone-shaped rock formations."
The fragment pulsed once more, intensely, before dimming to a steady glow. The message remained briefly projected on the wall, then faded like smoke.
"Well," Aya said into the stunned silence. "I guess we are going to Cappadocia."
Chapter 17
"Stone flowers," Leyla repeated, pulling up satellite images of Cappadocia on her tablet. The region's distinctive landscape filled the screen, showing a surreal terrain of conical rock formations rising from the Anatolian plateau. "The locals call the fairy chimneys 'Peribacaları.’ Fairy chimneys or stone flowers, depending on the translation."
"Göreme has the highest concentration," Karim noted, examining the images over her shoulder. "But which specific formation? There are thousands."
"At least we can narrow it down. The markings from the workshop indicated a specific district and underground network, then we can hope the artifacts guide us when we get there," Aya said.
Amina carefully placed the still-glowing fragment on the map, where it illuminated the paper with an ethereal blue light. The brass cylinder from the antique shop seemed to respond, its etched patterns briefly glimmering. "The components are connected," she observed. "They want to be reunited."
For the next hour, they worked methodically to identify possible locations, cross-reference historical accounts, and study tourist access points to Cappadocia's underground cities.
"The main underground complexes are Derinkuyu and Kaymaklı," Leyla explained. "Both are partially open to tourists, but extensive sections remain unexplored or restricted."
"Perfect hiding places," Aya said. "Çelebi could have sealed off chambers centuries ago that remain undisturbed. I mean, especially considering the secret chamber he and his people had at the mosque."
"We'll need supplies," Karim said, making notes. "Proper digging equipment, lighting, and climbing gear."
"And plenty of weapons," Amina added. "Aegis won't be far behind."
"I have a contact in the region," Leyla offered. "A former colleague who should be willing to provide support without asking too many questions. I’ll call him, and he can prepare everything for our arrival."
"How soon can we leave?" Aya asked.
Leyla quickly searched on her phone. "First flight is tomorrow morning at 6:05 with Pegasus Airlines. Approximately an hour in the air to Nevşehir Kapadokya Airport, then another hour by road to Göreme. Could be there around 8:30."
"Maybe we should split up," Amina said. "Take different routes, minimize the chance of us all being intercepted."
They continued planning, mapping contingencies, escape routes, and rendezvous points. As the strategy took shape, Aya noticed Karim becoming increasingly withdrawn, his contributions precise but distant. When Leyla and Amina moved to the kitchen to plate the late dinner that Amina had picked up, Aya took the opportunity to approach him.
"Hey," she said softly, standing beside him at the window. "You've been quiet."
Karim kept his gaze fixed on the Istanbul skyline. "Just focused on the mission."
"Karim..." Aya began, searching for the right words. "About what Amina said—"
"It's fine," he interrupted. "Really. Your past is your past."
"It's not fine," she insisted. "I can see it's bothering you, and we can't afford that kind of distraction right now."
He turned to face her, his expression carefully composed. "Right, because of the mission. What do you want me to say, Aya? That I'm not surprised you didn't tell me about a significant relationship you had with the person we’ve been living with? That it doesn't matter if the person I've been living and working side-by-side with for months was your lover? Does this not make me feel like you were deceiving me?”
"I should have told you," she said. "But it was over long before Morocco, before you and I ever met. I didn’t expect to see her again."
"You said that. But then why hide it?"
"Because it ended badly. Really badly," she admitted. "Because some parts of my past I prefer not to revisit. With anyone. But I’ll tell you the full story when we have time."
A subtle shift came over his expression. "And now?"
Aya glanced toward the kitchen, where Amina's voice carried. "Now, we need to focus on the mission, and we still need Amina to do that," she said firmly. "But I really care about you in every way I’ve said. I want all the things we said we want. A future together. Once we've secured the lens, once Aegis is no longer hunting us, we'll have that, and a much longer talk about our lives. Properly, every painful detail."
Karim studied her face, then nodded slowly. "Okay. Mission first." He hesitated. "But I need to know one thing: is there still something between you two? Any feelings?"
The question hung in the air, direct and unavoidable. Aya held his gaze. "Amina was the most important thing in the world to me once. Those feelings don't just disappear. But what I feel for you is different. Real. Present."
It wasn't a complete answer, but it was honest.
"Thank you," he said quietly. "For not pretending it's simpler than it is."
The moment was interrupted by a soft clearing of the throat. They turned to find Amina standing a few paces away, her expression uncharacteristically vulnerable.
"Sorry to interrupt," she said. "But I needed to say something." She took a breath. "To both of you."
Aya instinctively moved closer to Karim.
"I shouldn't have said what I did," Amina continued. "It was unprofessional and unfair to both of you." She straightened, meeting their eyes directly. "I'm not sorry for our past, and I still care for you, Aya. I’ll always love you, and I won't pretend otherwise. But I shouldn't have dropped it like that, and I also respect the hell out of you both. We have bigger problems, and we can only face them together."
The words momentarily stunned them both.
"Thank you," Karim said finally, with a pained smile.
"We're good," Aya said.
Amina nodded, some of her customary poise returning. "Good. Because the food’s spread out and Leyla's about to get us on a line with Salah."
On cue, Leyla's secure phone chimed from the kitchen. She answered immediately, switching to speaker as they gathered around.
"So you're all alive?" Salah's voice came through, tense with concern.
"All present and mostly intact," Aya said. "What's happening on your end?"
"Complications, sister, complications," Salah said. "I've been monitoring these Aegis communications and tracking their movements, and it’s coming at an unprecedented scale."
"Looking for us?" Karim asked.
"Partly, khoya. But there's more." The sound of keyboard clicks carried through the speaker. "I tapped some footage that you all really need to feast your eyes on. Sending it now."
Leyla's tablet pinged with an incoming file. She opened it to reveal security camera footage from what appeared to be a large, imposing government building. The timestamp showed it was recorded earlier that day.
The grainy video showed a conference room where several figures sat around a polished table. Malik entered, accompanied by two men who appeared to be bodyguards. The two men in suits, seated at the table, rose and greeted him.
"Who are they?" Aya asked.
“Shit,” Leyla said. “That’s Deputy Minister Mehmet Saruhan. He commands the Interior Ministry’s counter-terror apparatus.” She indicated the second official. “And that’s Professor Cemal Dündar, the Director-General for Cultural Heritage and Museums. Every excavation permit or antiquities seizure in Turkey crosses his desk.”
"Aegis has some hot-shot government connections now, it would seem," Salah confirmed. "I’m thinking it’s the kind of thing where they have official authorization to 'recover stolen antiquities' and 'apprehend foreign agents operating on Turkish soil.'"
"That's us," Amina said dryly.
"Yes, ma’am. And it gets worse," Salah continued. "Based on a couple of emails I phished from a secretary, they've been granted access to national security resources. Airport surveillance, border control, police cooperation."
"So we're not just running from Aegis anymore," Aya said. "We're evading the entire state apparatus, and we need to get on a flight."
"How did they secure that level of cooperation?" Karim asked.
"Money," Leyla suggested. "Influence. Perhaps blackmail. We know how extensive their network is, how many corporations and billionaires are linked. Plus, maybe they've convinced officials the lens has national security implications. That type of thing plays well in this administration."
"All of the above," Salah confirmed. "But there's something else driving their urgency, a specific timeline."
He sent another file that contained an astronomical chart with dates and coordinates. "This was extracted from communications between Malik and what I can only guess is Aegis headquarters. They're preparing for some kind of celestial event occurring in three days."
Karim studied the chart. "It's a planetary alignment. Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn form a perfect triangle with this specific star constellation as backdrop."
"The Pleiades," Salah identified. "The Seven Sisters, you might call them. Yeah, your boy loved some Star Trek as a kid and got big time into space."
"Well, this matches Çelebi's notes on identifying specific alignments," Karim said, pulling up images from the mosque workshop. “His calculations attempted to predict times when the lens would be most powerful. I guess this is one of them."
"A three-day window," Aya murmured. "That's all the time we have to find the remaining components and secure them before Aegis can, and they attempt an activation."
Amina stared at the artifacts on the table, the fragment still pulsing with faint light. "We should destroy them."
Three pairs of eyes turned to her.
"I'm serious," she continued, her voice hard. "Smash the fragment. Melt the cylinder. If the lens requires all components to function, destroying even one should render the entire system useless. Problem solved."
"That assumes we know how many total components exist," Karim countered. "What if there are backups? Alternative pieces Aegis has already manufactured? We know Abdelatif probably produced this lens."
"Then we destroy those other ones too when we find them, and take the fight right to Malik once we figure out where he plans on arranging this big Astral Lens convergence." Amina's hand moved unconsciously to her arm. "I've felt what this kind of power does. In Morocco, the Amulet nearly consumed me. Nearly consumed all of us. Some things shouldn't exist."
Leyla leaned forward, her expression thoughtful. "The instinct is understandable, but destruction might not be as simple as it sounds. These aren't ordinary artifacts. They're designed to channel cosmic energy, so breaking them could release whatever's stored inside."
"She's right," Karim said reluctantly. "Remember what happened when we destroyed the Amulet? The energy discharge nearly leveled the Atlas Mountains. Took Abdelatif with it." He shook his head. "If these components contain even a fraction of that stored power, smashing them in an Istanbul apartment with millions of people on the line could be catastrophic."
Amina's jaw tightened, but she didn't argue.
"So we can't destroy them safely," Aya said slowly. "And we can't just hide them and hope Malik gives up; he's too invested, too close to the alignment."
"Then what's the play?" Amina demanded. "We keep collecting pieces until we've assembled exactly what he wants?"
"I hear you, but we can’t risk leaving any available if we don’t know which Malik may have already replicated," Aya said, flipping through Hassan's notebook to a page she'd studied multiple times. "Look at this. My father's notes from his final years. He references something he calls the 'crown lens.’ It looks like it’s not just another component, but the termination mechanism. The control system." She traced her finger along Hassan's handwriting. "He writes that without it, any activation becomes irreversible. With it, the system can be safely powered down even after ignition."
"So it's a kill-switch to refocus or close the energy vacuum," Leyla said, leaning closer to read.
"Yeah," Aya continued. "And as far as my father could figure out, it's the only kill switch. My father experimented with a partial array; the notes are vague, but he mentions catastrophic results. He concluded that partial assemblies would be more dangerous than complete ones because they lack the control mechanisms."
Amina's hand moved to her arm. "Look what happened with the Amulet in Morocco when we destroyed it. The energy had to go somewhere. It nearly tore apart half the Atlas Mountains and took Abdelatif with it."
"Exactly," Aya said. "And if we destroy what we have now, we don't prevent Malik from trying, we just guarantee he tries with an incomplete system that can't be safely terminated."
"But we'd deny him the components," Karim argued. "Without these pieces, why would he attempt anything?"
"Because he probably already has a few components," Leyla said quietly. "Aegis has been moving equipment. Large cases under heavy security. They're not starting from zero, Karim. Malik has resources, access to other caches we don't know about, maybe even duplicates of some components. While you were dealing with Léglise’s project, he’s been here in Turkey. Before that, he was here working on this for years."
"So if we hide what we have," Amina said slowly, "Malik still attempts activation at the alignment with whatever partial array he's assembled. And without this crown lens as the termination mechanism—"
"He might trigger something he can't stop," Aya finished. "Uncontrolled dimensional fractures across Istanbul. Millions at risk. Who knows?"
"Then what's the play?" Karim asked, frustration cracking through his voice. "We can't destroy them safely, we can't hide them and hope he gives up—"
"We need to keep the crown lens under our control," Aya said. "We find it before he does. And if he makes his move at the alignment—and I think he still might make his move even without all the pieces because he's too invested to stop—we're there. In the room. With the one component that gives us the power to terminate whatever he starts."
"You're talking about walking into his ritual," Karim said. "Bringing him what he needs."
"No," Aya countered. "I'm talking about making sure someone with the kill switch is standing next to the ignition if he throws it. Our choice is whether we face that from a distance and hope for the best, or whether we position ourselves to stop what he starts."
Leyla nodded slowly. "So we collect components and try to protect them and prevent an attempt. If he goes ahead and has more than we expect, it’s less about preventing his attempted activation. It's about surviving it."
"And making sure Istanbul survives it," Aya added. She looked around the table, meeting each person's eyes. "This is a more dangerous plan than hiding or running. But it's the only one that accounts for what we can't control: Malik's resources, his determination, and the reality that he's going to activate something at that alignment no matter what we do."
The silence that followed felt heavy with acceptance.
"Okay, we find the crown lens first," Amina said, finally. "And we make damn sure we're the ones holding it when the moment comes."
"I’ll leave this all to you guys,” Salah interrupted. “But Leyla filled me in, and I took care of the details. Your flights are booked. Different carriers, different times, all converging on Nevşehir tomorrow morning. I've sent the details and made sure to make the transactions untraceable."
"Thank you, Salah," Aya said.
“Peace, my people,” Salah said. “If there’s anything else, I’ll be in touch.”


Two hours later, exhaustion finally claimed them, one by one. Karim dozed on the couch, Aya retired to the bedroom to rest her injury, and Amina stretched out on the floor with characteristic disregard for comfort. Leyla waited until their breathing had settled into sleep rhythms, then silently retrieved the burner phone from her bag. 
She moved to the hallway outside the apartment, easing the door shut behind her with practiced care. She dialed the memorized number.
Malik answered immediately. "Report."
"They've found the next lead. Cappadocia. Çelebi hid components in the underground cities near Göreme." She kept her voice low. "The fragment projected a code when Amina held it. Some kind of encoded message system."
"The components are guiding them." Malik's voice carried satisfaction. "Hassan theorized they were designed to be reunited. Excellent."
"They're planning to leave tomorrow morning. Different flights, different routes."
"I'll have teams in position. We'll maintain surveillance but won't intercept. Not yet. Let them do the excavation work. The underground cities are treacherous, and Hassan's daughter has proven remarkably capable at navigating Çelebi's puzzles."
Leyla's grip tightened on the phone. "So the alignment is in three days, like Salah said."
"Correct." A pause. "The crown lens is the priority. Everything else is secondary. If they locate it, you take it. Whatever it costs."
"And if they find other components first?"
"Let them collect everything. A complete array is more valuable than fragments. But the crown lens..." His voice hardened. "That piece doesn't leave your sight once they find it. It's the control mechanism. Without it, activation is unpredictable. With it, we shape what happens next."
Leyla pictured them, sleeping inside. They trusted her now. Completely.
"I understand," she said.
"One more thing. I'm accelerating the pressure. They'll detect our surveillance soon, perhaps tonight. Fear will keep them moving fast, and speed means mistakes. When they reach the underground cities, they'll be desperate enough to take risks they'd normally avoid."
"You're herding them."
"I'm guiding them toward the finish line. As you pointed out, we are running short on time." The line crackled briefly. "And Dr. Yilmaz? Emre asks about you. He's worried. I told him you're doing everything necessary to bring him home."
The words landed like a blade between her ribs.
"Three days," Malik said. "Then this ends."
The line went dead.
She ended the call and stood motionless for a moment, listening. Nothing but the building's ambient creaks and distant traffic. 
Back in the apartment, everyone remained asleep. She returned the phone to her bag, then settled into the armchair by the window, her designated watch position.



Aya awoke to a strange electronic tone emanating from the apartment's security system, a low, pulsing alarm that gradually increased in volume.
"What's that?" Karim asked, jumping from the sofa.
Leyla ran to a panel near the door, swearing under her breath as she read the display. "Perimeter breach,” she said.
"How?" Aya demanded. "We switched all devices, used burner phones."
"It's not our communications," Leyla replied, switching to another screen. "I don’t know, but they’re here."
On the table, both artifacts had begun to pulse with increasing intensity, the fragment's blue glow synchronizing with the cylinder's amber light.
"Oh shit, they're communicating," Amina realized, the markings on her arm tingling in response. "Calling to each other, and to the remaining pieces. If Aegis has even one component, as we suspected, they could be using it to track us right now."
Aya swore under her breath. "How long until they’re in?"
"Minutes," Leyla estimated, already moving to gather essential equipment. "Maybe less."
"We need to split up now," Aya decided immediately. "Different routes to Cappadocia, just as we planned. Amina, you and Karim take the cylinder. Leyla and I will take the fragment. With my side injured, I think it’s the best plan."
Everyone nodded.
"We stay ahead of Aegis and keep the components separated until we reach Cappadocia. Let’s go,” Amina said.
As they gathered their equipment and notes, the security panel emitted another warning tone.
Leyla announced, "We have three minutes, maximum."
The team gathered essential items. Leyla distributed new phones. "Secure lines, untraceable. Try to use only in an emergency."
"Karim," Aya said as they prepared to separate. "Be careful."
He met her gaze, words passing unspoken between them. "You too."
Amina secured the cylinder in a pouch. "See you all in fairyland.”
The security panel issued a final warning, a rapid series of beeps indicating imminent breach.
"Time to go," Leyla called, leading them toward the emergency exit.
They slipped into the night, splitting into pairs before reaching the street. As Aya and Leyla moved toward the east, Karim and Amina moved west, the artifacts pulsed in their separate containers.
Chapter 18
"Stairwell B leads to the parking garage," Leyla said as they sprinted down the hallway, checking a floor plan illuminated by emergency lighting. "Amina and Karim, take the left exit."
They pushed through a fire door into the stairwell just as the heavy thud of boots echoed. Leyla froze, holding up a fist. They pressed against the wall as voices carried down the concrete shaft.
"Team Two in position," a male voice reported. "Deploying ES-7 capture devices on floors sixteen through fourteen."
"ES-7?" Aya mouthed silently.
"Electrostatic restraint nets. Military prototype. At least they're not here to kill; they want us alive, no matter what Malik said."
They descended as quietly as possible, counting floors as they went. Above them, doors banged open. When they reached the parking garage, Leyla guided them toward a maintenance door rather than the main entrance.
"They'll have the vehicle exits covered. Hopefully not this one," she said, producing a small electronic device from her bag. She attached it to the door's alarm contacts, bypassing the system.
The door opened onto a narrow alley behind the building. Rain had begun to fall, slicking the cobblestones and reducing visibility.
"We need to reach the ferry terminal," Leyla whispered. "It's our best exit route."
They zigzagged between overhead balconies. The rain intensified, plastering Aya's hair to her face and soaking through her clothing.
"Two men, leather jackets, northwest corner," Aya called.
Leyla nodded, steering them forward, adopting the hunched posture and hurried pace of locals eager to get home.
"Fuck. Drone," Leyla warned suddenly, glancing skyward. A small quadcopter hovered above, its camera swiveling to scan the crowd.
"Split up," Aya decided. "Meet at point B."
Without waiting for confirmation, she veered toward an overflowing bar, with what appeared to be students huddling close under the minimal shelter. Leyla disappeared in the opposite direction, melting into the night.
Aya stayed with the group until the men had moved on, then broke away toward a side street that would lead to the waterfront.
Eventually, she reached the Bosphorus, where the ferry terminal bustled with late-night commuters heading to Istanbul's European side. She scanned the area, identifying two more possible Aegis operatives or plain-clothes police stationed near the ticket barriers.
She pulled out her phone, sending a quick encrypted message to Amina and Karim: “Airport plan compromised. Need new tickets. Nevşehir-Kapadokya. Different carrier. Tonight, if possible.”
Amina's response came seconds later: “Already safe and working on it. Turkish Airlines has three seats on the 2 AM flight. Handling fourth.”
Aya texted back: “Confirmed.”
She slipped the phone back into her pocket. Changing flights was risky but necessary. Salah had booked them on separate morning flights, but if Aegis was moving now, and had access to government systems, those reservations were potentially already flagged. Better to move immediately.
Movement caught her eye, and through the rain, she recognized Leyla, boarding a small motorboat. She diverted toward a commercial pier where fishing boats bobbed against their moorings.
Aya picked up her pace. By the time she reached the boat, Leyla had the engine idling. Aya leapt aboard, grimacing as the impact jolted her injured side.
"The ferry’s well covered, but it doesn’t look like they expected us there," Leyla said, untying mooring lines. "This gets us across to the European side, where we can circle back to the airport via taxi."
The boat pulled away from the pier just as shouts erupted behind them. Flashlight beams cut through the rain, converging on their position. The engine roared as Leyla opened the throttle, sending them skimming across the choppy water of the Bosphorus.
"Amina and Karim?" Leyla asked over the engine's growl.
"En route to the rendezvous. I just messaged," Aya replied, watching the receding lights of Kadıköy. "How did you arrange this boat so quickly?"
"I didn't," Leyla admitted. "Borrowed it from someone who won't miss it until morning."
The crossing took fifteen minutes, water spraying over the gunwales as they cut through rolling waves and got lashed with the rain. Leyla navigated, keeping them away from major shipping lanes while maintaining their heading toward the Galataport marina.
They docked at a small private marina, abandoning the boat without ceremony and emerging onto a quiet street lined with high-end boutiques, now shuttered for the night. Leyla checked her watch.
"We have ninety minutes before boarding closes," she said, scanning the area. "Sabiha Gökçen is on the Asian side, so we need to cross back over the water."
"We just came from there," Aya said, pressing a hand to her throbbing side.
"Exactly why they won't expect us to return." Leyla was already moving, leading them toward a main avenue where taxis occasionally cruised past. "Aegis will be watching the Istanbul Airport now, on this side."
Aya's phone chimed with an encrypted message from Amina: “Tickets confirmed. Boarding passes mobile. Still need your ID scan.”
"Cover me," Aya murmured, ducking into a recessed doorway. She quickly took a photo of her forged passport, sending it through. Within seconds, Amina replied with a digital boarding pass.
Leyla flagged down a passing taxi. The driver, a middle-aged man with salt-and-pepper stubble, eyed their rain-soaked appearance with suspicion.
"Sabiha Gökçen," Leyla asked him, adding something in Turkish that made him nod vigorously.
"What did you tell him?" Aya asked as they settled into the back seat.
"That we're flight attendants late for our shift and there's a substantial tip if he gets us there in thirty minutes." Leyla's smile was thin. "Amazing how quickly traffic laws become optional."
The driver proved her right, weaving through traffic with alarming speed. They crossed the Bosphorus via the July 15 Martyrs Bridge, its suspension cables illuminated against the night sky.
"Amina and Karim?" Leyla asked quietly.
"Already there. They took a more direct route." Aya glanced at her phone. "They've secured the boarding passes, and we’re checked in."
"Your old friend is impressive."
"She always was." Aya gazed out at the city lights reflecting off the Bosphorus. "Amina can talk or fight her way into anywhere."
They lapsed into silence as the taxi sped through the night. Eventually, the airport's terminal came into view, its curved roof glowing with ambient light.
Leyla paid the driver with a generous tip, then turned to Aya. "Amina sent me the info. My boarding pass is for a later flight. But I have standby for your flight, and a good word that there’s a no-show passenger."
"And if something goes wrong?"
"Stick to protocol. Cappadocia, central square, noon." Leyla adjusted her glasses. "Remember, they're looking for four people traveling together. We're just strangers who happen to be flying on the same night."
With a final nod, they separated. Aya approached the terminal entrance, shoulders relaxed, expression neutral, just another weary traveler eager to be home.
They separated again, standing in different security lines. Aya selected a lane supervised by a younger officer who appeared tired, less attentive. She presented her boarding pass and forged passport, maintaining the relaxed posture of a routine business traveler.
The officer barely glanced at her documents before waving her through to the scanner. As she stepped into the full-body imaging device, she maintained regular breathing, consciously relaxing muscles that would otherwise betray her anxiety.
A moment of tension as the machine completed its cycle. The officer monitoring the display frowned slightly, tapping his screen. Aya prepared for confrontation, mentally cataloging escape routes.
"Injury?" the officer asked, pointing to her side where the bandages and wound created an anomaly on the scan.
"Insulin pump," Aya lied. "I can show you documentation."
He waved her through with disinterest. "No need. Have a good flight."
Beyond security, Aya caught sight of Karim clearing his own checkpoint, the bag containing the cylinder passing through X-ray without incident.
Aya sat down beside him to retie her shoes and spoke without acknowledging him. "Amina?" she asked.
"Already through security and headed to the gate," Karim confirmed without glancing her way. "No complications. Leyla?"
“Just behind us,” Aya confirmed, and they separated.
The final test came at the gate.
As the line inched forward, Aya saw the agent speaking into his wrist microphone, potentially receiving updated intelligence.
Amina was already seated when Aya boarded, her eyes fixed on the window, watching the ground crew perform final checks. She'd made subtle adjustments to her appearance, dulling her attractive looks. Her hair was pulled back in a messy bun, thick reading glasses perched on her nose, her usual confident posture replaced by something more timid.
"Cutting it close," she murmured as Aya slid into the seat beside her.
"Long story on the getaway," Aya whispered. "Then my bandages flagged their system, and I about panicked."
Amina hesitated. "Listen, again, about what I said earlier—"
"Seriously, not now," Aya cut her off, keeping her voice gentle. "We'll have time for that conversation later. No more apologies until then. Right now, we need to focus on staying alive and finding what we came for."
Amina nodded. "Whatever you say. Karim's three rows behind us. Leyla should have a standby seat toward the front in Business class. We've got the aircraft covered."
"Any sign of hostiles?" Aya asked, scanning nearby passengers without turning her head.
"Two possibilities," Amina replied, pretending to adjust her seatbelt. "Woman in a suit by the lavatory. Keeps checking her watch and scanning faces. And a man in row twelve—athletic build, situational awareness too high for a civilian."
"They might just be security officers," Aya noted. "Every flight has air marshals these days."
"Maybe." Amina didn't sound convinced.
The cabin door remained open well past the scheduled departure time. Flight attendants conferred in hushed tones near the galley. Aya's anxiety mounted with each passing minute.
Finally, the distinctive sound of the door mechanism engaged. Relief washed over her when Aya noticed a flight attendant escorting a late arrival to the business class cabin—Leyla, slightly disheveled but maintaining perfect composure.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for our delay tonight," came the captain's voice over the intercom. "We've been cleared for departure and will be pushing back momentarily, scheduled to get into Cappadocia about one hour after scheduled."
The plane began its slow retreat from the gate, taxiing toward the runway. Only when they accelerated into takeoff, the pressure pushing Aya back into her seat, did she allow herself a relaxing deep breath.
Istanbul fell away beneath them, the sprawling megalopolis becoming a distant light against the darkness.
The aircraft banked eastward, climbing through cloud layers and the dissipated storm toward cruising altitude. The cabin lights dimmed to a calm blue. Aya slipped her hand into her pocket, fingers brushing against the pouch containing a piece of Çelebi’s glass. Even through the protective material, she could sense its power, as if recognizing they were drawing closer to its original home.
As the jet continued its journey through the night sky, Aya gazed out at the stars visible above the cloud layer. Somewhere in that vast expanse, celestial bodies were aligning just as they had in Çelebi's time, creating a window of opportunity that would soon close.
Three days to find the remaining components. Three days to prevent Aegis from assembling a device of unfathomable power. Three days that would determine whether ancient secrets remained buried or emerged to reshape the modern world. Again.
The thought should have terrified her. Instead, it filled her with a strange sense of purpose. Her father had dedicated his life to this quest, and now the responsibility had passed to her, a legacy written in stardust and blood. 
Cappadocia beckoned.

Chapter 19
The aircraft touched down with a jolt an hour and a half later, tires bouncing on the tarmac of Nevşehir Kapadokya Airport. Aya remained motionless in her seat as other passengers stirred around her.
"One step closer," Amina murmured beside her, gazing through the small window at the austere landscape, barely visible through the darkness.
Aya kept her movements casual, deliberately avoiding eye contact with Karim and Leyla as they made their way through the small terminal. 
Aya and Amina headed for the AutoUnion rental car counter, Karim and Leyla not far behind them at the Europcar booth. 
"We need to rent a car for three days, please," Aya told the attendant, sliding over her forged license.
The young man with tired eyes and a name tag reading "Ali" processed the paperwork, and ten minutes later, they were loading their bags into a dusty silver Fiat.
"Definitely feels like we're being watched," Amina said.
Aya started the engine. "Probably are. The question now is whether it's Aegis or local police on alert. We’re stuck with both."
"Still, we stick to the plan. Göreme, central square. Leyla made contact with her friend here, right?"
"Should have," Aya replied, pulling onto the two-lane highway that cut through the stark landscape. "Though I'm not entirely comfortable putting our lives in the hands of another ex-criminal whose name we don't even know."
"You trusted me when we met in Florence," Amina pointed out with a half-smile. "And we both know how sketchy my résumé was."
"Different circumstances."
"Different how?" Amina tilted her head, studying Aya's profile. "Because you were dying to sleep with me?"
Aya's grip tightened on the steering wheel, and she kept her eyes locked on the road, watching the first light of morning threatening on the 5 o’clock horizon. 
"Because I'd seen your work. I knew your capabilities, plus Léglise vouched for you, and I trusted him then. At that time, I was the unproven element."
"Fair enough, habibi."
They drove in silence for several minutes, the landscape gradually transforming around them. Rolling hills gave way to more dramatic topography: pale, undulating rock that appeared almost liquid, as if the earth itself had turned liquid and then froze mid-flow.
"I see why they call them stone flowers," Amina said softly as the first fairy chimneys came into view. They were towering, conical formations crowned with darker stone caps, rising from the valley floor like misshapen obelisks. "They look alive. They're beautiful."
"And hiding something beneath them," Aya added, eyes still locked on the horizon, refusing the glance over at Amina. It was supposed to be Leyla beside her, until the plan got upended.
Signs for cave hotels and balloon tours appeared with greater frequency as they approached Göreme. Despite the hour, hot air balloons already dotted the sky, drifting dots of color. 
Aya checked her phone. A text from Karim confirmed that he and Leyla had secured transport and would meet them as planned. "We all made it through the night," she said. "So far, so good."
"Don't jinx it," Amina warned, her eyes fixed on the side mirror. "I think we've got a tail."
Aya glanced back through the rearview mirror. A black SUV with tinted windows maintained a consistent distance. "Government plates?"
"Can't tell from here," Amina replied. "But they turned when we did at that last roundabout."
Aya considered their options. "Let's find out if they're following us or just heading to Göreme. There aren’t many other directions to head out here, to be fair."
She abruptly turned onto a smaller road that branched away from the main route. The SUV continued straight.
"False alarm?" Amina asked.
"Maybe." Aya frowned, unconvinced. "Or they're just smart enough to know they were made.”
They continued on the secondary road, which wound through a valley filled on either side with the fairy chimneys. The formations loomed closer here, some carved with windows and doors, evidence of the human habitation that had transformed these natural structures into homes and churches for centuries.
"This place feels... different," Amina said, her voice dropping to just above a whisper. She rolled up her sleeve, revealing the markings. In the morning light, they seemed more pronounced than they had been in Istanbul, the constellations more distinct. "It has that ancient, forbidden feeling. If these powers are from space, I can’t think of anywhere that looks more alien, save anything Gaudí built."
Amina winced suddenly, pulling her arm close to her body.
"What's wrong?" Aya asked, glancing over with concern.
"It's burning," Amina replied through gritted teeth. "Not like in Morocco, not that intense, and it feels different, but definitely responding to something here."
"Çelebi was from this region," Aya said. "And we know there may be a tie to Cambodia from my dad’s Khmer research. There may be a more significant connection to the powers in Morocco than we understand."
Amina nodded, taking slow, measured breaths until the sensation ebbed. "The fragment is reacting too. I can feel it pulsing."
They rejoined the main road just outside Göreme, the small town coming into view ahead. It was a collection of stone buildings and cave dwellings nestled among the fairy chimneys, with tourist buses already parked in designated areas, depositing visitors who clutched cameras and guidebooks.
Aya navigated through the crowds and construction until they reached the central square, parking in the shadow of a small mosque. They sat in silence, obscured from view by a wall of ATMs that occupied the center of the street, watching the gradually increasing flow of people as the day established itself.
"There," Amina said suddenly, nodding toward a café across the square.
Karim sat at an outdoor table, a Turkish tea and a guidebook in front of him. He gave no sign of recognizing them, though Aya knew he'd spotted their arrival.
"And Leyla?" Aya asked, scanning the area.
"By the tour booking office. Pretending to compare balloon packages."
Sure enough, Leyla stood examining a display of brochures, her hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, hiking clothes replacing her usual more sophisticated attire.
Aya's gaze shifted beyond Leyla to a man in a canvas jacket who seemed too interested in the same tour posters. His posture was wrong for a tourist. Too alert, too balanced on the balls of his feet.
"We've got company," she murmured. "Nine o'clock, canvas jacket. Military bearing."
"I see him," Amina confirmed. "And another by the fruit stand. They're not even trying to be subtle."
"They were expecting us," Aya said, frowning. "Malik knew we'd come here."
“Or we didn’t cover our tracks enough in the apartment. We left in quite a hurry; didn’t even get to eat my kebab.”
They exited the car casually, retrieving their backpacks as if they were just two more tourists arriving for an adventure. A glance back at the square confirmed that Karim had observed their arrival and was now settling his bill.
"Let's wait for them at that café," Aya suggested, nodding toward a small establishment with cave-cut seating areas. "More private, easier to talk and check if anyone’s trying to listen."
The café was nearly empty, too early for the main breakfast rush. They selected a table in a recessed alcove that offered sight lines to the entrance. A sleepy-eyed waiter took their order for coffee and Turkish breakfast with minimal interest.
Karim arrived next, sliding into a seat across from them with practiced casualness. "We clear?"
"As much as we can be," Aya replied. "But Malik's people are already here. I counted at least two watching the square."
"Three," Karim corrected, his voice low. "One positioned on the rooftop of a bar, overlooking the main approach. Professional setup."
Leyla joined them last, her manner relaxed but her eyes constantly moving. She sat beside Karim, accepting the coffee that arrived shortly after.
"I've made contact with my asset," she said without preamble. "He runs a hotel now on the eastern ridge, in addition to his other businesses. We'll meet him there at noon."
"And he’s completely trustworthy?" Amina asked.
Leyla's gaze flickered to Amina's markings, visible beneath her rolled sleeve. "I have trusted Hamza with my life. And he’s one of the few people who might understand what happened to you in Morocco." She hesitated. "And he has... personal reasons to resist Aegis."
"Which are?" Aya prompted, sensing Leyla was holding back.
Leyla sighed, setting down her coffee cup. "I suppose now is as good a time as any for full disclosure," she said, her voice dropping further. "My connection to all this runs deeper than I initially revealed, but we’re in the shit pretty deep now, so gloves off."
The three looked at her expectantly.
"I didn't just correspond with Emre academically," she continued. "We worked together in Turkish intelligence before I left for academia. Specifically, we were with a division of MİT that specialized in protecting cultural heritage sites with national security implications."
"Cultural heritage with security implications?" Karim repeated skeptically.
"Turkey sits at the crossroads of civilizations," Leyla explained. "Some ancient sites contain more than just historical significance. Some harbor secrets that could... destabilize current power structures if misused."
Aya's brow furrowed. "And Çelebi's lens fell into that category."
"Exactly. For years, we monitored various groups showing interest in Ottoman astronomical research. Most were harmless academics, but occasionally we'd encounter more concerning entities."
"Like Aegis," Amina guessed.
"Not initially," Leyla replied. "At first, it was just one researcher. Brilliant, dedicated, and seemingly genuine in his academic pursuits." She paused. "That was Malik."
The revelation hung in the air between them.
"You worked with Malik?" Aya asked, voice sharpening.
"He wasn't Malik then, at least not to me. We knew him as Professor Osman. He approached our department as an academic seeking access to restricted archives. His credentials were impeccable, his research methodology sound. And for three years, I was his primary intelligence liaison."
"What happened?" Karim asked.
"He changed," Leyla said. "Or perhaps he revealed his true nature. He began seeking increasingly sensitive materials, becoming obsessed with legends. He wanted access to sealed sections of underground complexes here in Cappadocia."
"And you granted it?" Amina asked.
"Some of it," Leyla admitted. "Until I realized he was building a parallel research team. That's when I flagged him as a security concern." She took a sip of her coffee. "A week later, my supervisor called me in, said the investigation was closed, and transferred me to a desk position, maintaining a catalog."
"He had protection," Aya guessed.
"The highest levels," Leyla confirmed. "Within months, he'd disappeared from academic circles entirely. This begins my obsession with the lens and Çelebi, trying to put a stop to whatever he was up to, fearing the power he was amassing. Emre was recruited to the agency because of his expertise in the Cappadocia region. His family has lived there forever, and as time went on, he suspected that he was best positioned to stop Malik. Emre helped me continue to monitor Malik, tracking a pattern of acquisitions and expeditions that made no sense unless you understood what he was truly seeking."
"The lens," Karim said.
"Not just the lens," Leyla corrected. "The knowledge behind it. As we know, Çelebi wasn't just creating a device; he was developing a comprehensive understanding of cosmic energy manipulation that centuries later remains beyond conventional science."
"And Emre?" Aya asked. "What happened to him?"
Pain flashed across Leyla's face before she controlled it. "Three months ago, he called me, excited. He'd found something in an abandoned section of Derinkuyu, something he only found because his family protects some of the old tunnels. He said he’d found markings similar to those in Çelebi's manuscripts. He sent photos, promised more details after a final expedition." Her voice tightened. "That was the last I heard from him. His apartment was cleared out, and his university position was mysteriously terminated. It was as if he'd never existed. Anyone I asked denied ever knowing such a man, or quickly hurried away in fear."
"Until Omar contacted you," Amina said.
"Yes. When he mentioned Aegis and the lens, everything connected. Malik had resurfaced with organizational backing, continuing what he'd started years ago."
The implications settled over the group. Aya studied Leyla's face, searching for any sign of deception but finding only controlled anger and determination.
"There's one more thing," Leyla said after a moment. "Hamza, my contact here, was working extensively with Emre. He's been searching for him as well since his disappearance. When I mentioned your interest in Çelebi's work, he agreed to help on the condition that we also help find Emre."
"You think he's still alive?" Karim asked.
"I have to," Leyla replied, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. "If Malik took him, it's because he needs his expertise. Emre knew these underground networks, but he learned it all from Hamza, and you heard how Malik dangled him when he confronted us outside the mosque."
Amina suddenly inhaled sharply, faint blue light emanating from beneath her sleeve. "Whatever's here, it's affecting the fragment too."
Aya checked, and sure enough, the glass fragment in her bag emitted the same soft glow, visible even through the fabric.
"We need to move," Aya decided, glancing around the café. "When the components are reacting this strongly, Aegis has to be able to track them."
“Assuming they’ve got even a shard of their own,” Karim said, “they can listen for this same harmonic and triangulate.”
"Hamza's," Leyla said, already standing. "He'll know what to do, I think he knows more than he may realize, based on Emre’s recent work. He knew him well. Follow me."
They settled their bill quickly, exiting the café in pairs, Karim with Leyla, Aya with Amina. The square had grown busier, providing better cover as they moved through the crowds.
"Eleven o'clock," Aya murmured as they passed a souvenir shop. "Man in the blue jacket, talking into his collar."
"I see him," Amina confirmed. "And he definitely sees us."
They quickened their pace slightly, winding through narrower streets that climbed the hillside above Göreme. The tourist traffic thinned as they ascended, making them more conspicuous.
"We're exposed here," Amina warned, her discomfort making her voice tense.
"Almost there," Aya assured her, pointing toward a weathered building perched on the ridgeline ahead. A hand-painted sign beside its blue door read "Hamza's Cave Pension" in both Turkish and English.
As they approached, Aya couldn't shake the sensation of being watched—not just by the Aegis, but by the landscape itself. The fairy chimneys loomed around them like ancient guardians, their hollowed faces seeming to track their progress.
A man sat in a wicker chair outside, his deeply lined face turned toward the valley below. As they drew nearer, he rose, bringing with him a lingering smell of dampness.
"You're earlier than expected," he said, dark eyes assessing them with unnerving precision. "But perhaps that's for the best. They're already closing the net."
"Are you Hamza?" Aya asked.
The man nodded. "And you are Leyla's friends, seeking what should perhaps remain lost." His gaze fixed on Amina, or more specifically, on her arm where a map of the heavens glowed. "Ah," he said softly. "The djinn have touched you."
Amina stared back at him in surprise. "You recognize these?"
"I’m the storyteller around here. Old stories," Hamza said. "Stories most dismiss as superstition. Most everyone else always does, anyway." He gestured toward the blue door. "Come inside. We have more to discuss before your friends arrive."
As Aya followed him into the cool interior of the cave dwelling, she couldn't help but feel they'd crossed some invisible threshold. The stone flowers of Cappadocia had guarded their secrets for hundreds of years, secrets that endured only in the minds of people like Hamza. Now, those secrets were beginning to stir.
Chapter 20
The carved chambers of Hamza's lodge felt like stepping back in time. Stone walls, worn smooth by centuries of hands, opened up through the hillside, following the natural contours of the rock. Modern conveniences had been carefully integrated, with electrical wiring running along ancient grooves and copper plumbing threading through what looked like Byzantine archways, but they seemed almost apologetic in their presence, deferring to the enduring stone.
Aya found herself studying the space as they entered, cataloging exits and sight lines out of habit. The main chamber centered around a weathered wooden table surrounded by chairs of mismatched upholstery. Decades of hospitality had worn comfortable patterns into every surface.
But it was the massive brass instrument in the central alcove that made her stop short. Aya had no idea how it worked, but she knew what it was, and it told her they were in the right place.
A wide brass disk almost as big as a tabletop sat upright in a wooden stand, its outer rim carved with tiny tick marks like a clock face and its surface engraved with circles within circles like a map, packed with numbers, symbols, and curved lines. Over that engraved face sat a thinner layer of brass cut into an intricate web, like the framework of an antique globe, with small pointed tabs that marked specific stars and faint names scratched beside them in fading script. At the center, a single pin and a rounded knob gleamed, polished bright. It was a device built to measure the sky and turn starlight into answers.
The astrolabe dominated the space like a bronze sun. Nearly three feet across, its surface caught the lamplight and threw back patterns of shadow and gleam. Unlike the pristine museum pieces she'd seen during various jobs over the years, this one bore the patina of actual use. Its brass was darkened by countless hands, engravings worn smooth in places where fingers had repeatedly traced celestial paths.
"My family has lived in these stones for more than fifteen generations," Hamza said, settling into what was clearly his customary chair. The deep lines of his face seemed to deepen in the lamplight. "We were here before the sultans gave this place the name Cappadocia."
His gaze found Aya and held, measuring. “Amrani,” he said, as if tasting the name. "Your father's work reached even here. Hassan Amrani. He was… spoken of with respect among those who understand what we guard."
His dark eyes moved to Amina, who had unconsciously begun rubbing her arm again. The underground journey seemed to have intensified whatever connection existed between her and the artifacts they carried.
"You're in pain," he observed. It wasn't a question.
Amina looked up, startled to be so easily read by a stranger.
"This might help," Hamza continued, rising carefully. He moved to a cabinet carved directly into the cave wall. "Though I should warn you, the relief is only temporary, and the recipe is older than I can properly source."
From within the cabinet, he produced a small clay jar. The pale salve inside gave off scents of sage and cedar, with something else underneath, sharp and earthy, like the mountain air after a thunderstorm.
Amina hesitated, then dipped her fingers into the mixture. As she spread a thin layer over the patterns etched into her skin, her expression shifted from wariness to surprise. The constant burning sensation that had plagued her since entering Turkey began to ease almost immediately.
"Better?" Hamza asked.
She nodded, unable to suppress a soft sigh of relief. "How did you know it would work?"
"I didn't," he admitted with a smile, scratching his head. "But some old stories suggested that when certain energies stir, much like when Emre was interested in this place, particular herbs could provide comfort. It is my grandmother's recipe, and I thought it was worth trying."
The sound of approaching footsteps interrupted them. Karim and Leyla appeared in the doorway, escorted by a younger man who shared Hamza's angular features.
"Uncle," the young man said. "Perimeter is secure. No immediate concerns, but there's unusual vehicle activity in town. Too heavy for this time of year."
"Thank you, Mehmet. Bring tea for our guests, then return to your watch on the eastern approach."
After his nephew departed, Hamza turned his attention to Leyla. "It's been too long since you've visited us."
"For that, I’m sorry. I’m also sorry because I know what we're asking," Leyla said, her expression reflecting both gratitude and concern. "The risks involved—"
"Are relative, considering what is concerned," Hamza said with a dismissive wave. "Now, your message said you needed sanctuary and a guide through the underground cities, not lengthy discussions, though I admit curiosity about what brings such an unlikely group to my door."
His gaze moved across the room, taking them all in. "Show me what you've brought from Istanbul," he said.
Aya exchanged glances with the others, then carefully placed the glass fragment on the table's worn surface, the piece from Abdelatif's journal. Karim followed suit with the brass cylinder from the Kapanizade shop. Leyla added the cloth-wrapped fragments from Çelebi's workshop, spreading them beside the others. Four components, catching the lamplight as they settled onto the wood.
For a moment, nothing seemed to change. Then Aya noticed it. A faint vibration in the air, like the ringing echo of a bell she hadn't heard ring. Behind them, the massive astrolabe continued its lazy rotation. Or had it been moving before? She couldn't quite remember.
Hamza had gone very still, his weathered hands flat against the table. "Do you hear that?" he asked softly.
"Hear wh…" Karim started to say, but stopped. There was something, not quite sound, not quite silence. The astrolabe's brass began catching the light differently, throwing patterns that seemed almost deliberate.
"I thought it was decoration," Hamza said, staring at the astrolabe as if seeing it for the first time. "My great-grandfather's obsession with this thing. But look—" He pointed with a trembling finger. The same patterns etched into the artifacts were worked into the astrolabe's rim, so worn and tarnished they'd been nearly invisible until this moment, when they seemed to catch every available trace of light.
Hamza's eyes widened, and he murmured something imperceptible under his breath. Something warred in his voice when he finally spoke aloud. "I always assumed they were just stories. Legend to keep a boy interested in family history."
"You've seen these before?" Leyla asked.
"No, definitely not," Hamza said slowly, his attention split between the artifacts on the table and the increasingly active astrolabe. "But the symbols carved into their surfaces, those I recognize. My great-grandfather etched similar patterns into that astrolabe, but I thought it was for decoration." He shrugged.
Karim approached the astrolabe, bending low to study it. The astrolabe's rotation continued to accelerate until its movement became almost hypnotic. The intricate brass work threw shifting patterns of light and shadow across the chamber walls, creating an effect that was both beautiful and slightly unsettling.
"The fragment projected a message when we found it," Aya explained, watching Hamza's face for any sign of deeper knowledge. "Something about finding what we seek 'beneath the stone flowers.'"
Hamza nodded. "The stone flowers," he repeated, "you're in the right place. But as far as I know, this astrolabe has only served as a decoration." He paused, considering it again. "But, I do remember my grandfather polishing it for days on end, saying that one day it would sing. I never understood what he meant. He was an old man; he may have been losing it."
As if responding, the astrolabe's rotation stabilized into a steady, purposeful rhythm. The complex harmony created by its interaction with the artifacts resolved into something approaching melody, hauntingly beautiful, slow.
"What exactly did your great-grandfather tell you?" Aya asked. "In our experience, folklore can provide a lot more actionable answers than you might think."
"Fragments, mostly. Stories about buried treasures in the deep places beneath the fairy chimneys." Hamza's weathered hands moved to specific points on the astrolabe's rim, following patterns his fingers seemed to remember without conscious direction. "He taught me a child's rhyme about following the shepherd's path when the seven sisters dance with the wandering stars. Like poetry."
"The Pleiades," Karim said immediately. "And planetary alignment. Your grandfather was encoding actual astronomical coordinates in children's verses."
"That's the constellation Salah was focused on," Leyla said.
Before anyone could respond, Amina gasped. Her tattooed arm flared beneath the salve's temporary suppression, lines of blue tracing the constellation pattern. The glass fragment on the table responded in kind, its luminescence intensifying until it cast stark shadows across the chamber. "Here we go again. Something's happening," she managed through gritted teeth. "The components are reacting to that sound, I think."
Mehmet's urgent voice called from the chamber entrance. 
"No time for tea then. Vehicles approaching the valley in haste," Hamza translated, any sense of wonder hardening. "Government plates."
"Aegis," Aya said. "They've found us."
"Then we have little time. This is what happened when they came for Emre," Hamza said, moving toward a solid section of carved wall.
Leyla went still. "They came here? To your home?"
"They came everywhere," Hamza said, his fingers already finding barely visible depressions in the stone. "But they didn't find what they were looking for. Neither did Emre, for that matter."
Leyla's hands had curled into fists at her sides.
Before Hamza could press the hidden mechanism, an explosion shook the hillside. Dust rained from the ceiling. Outside, shouts rang out in Turkish, the clatter of heavy boots on stone.
"Now," Hamza said, pressing the sequence with practiced speed. "We go now."
The previously solid stone wall pivoted inward as it had at the Süleymaniye Mosque, revealing a hidden darkness beyond that carried the damp scent of vast, enclosed spaces.
"Grab the components," Aya ordered, already moving. Karim swept the artifacts into his pack while Leyla secured the wrapped fragments. Another explosion, closer this time, rattled the chamber. The astrolabe's song cut off abruptly.
"The astrolabe," Karim said. "We need to understand—"
"We need to move," Hamza said. "It sang and settled on the Shepherd. See?”
Aya caught a last glimpse. The rotating pointers had locked into a new geometry, a cluster of gemstones flaring in a pattern that echoed the marks on Amina’s arm.
They plunged into the passage as a third explosion blew out the lodge's front entrance. The hidden door swung shut behind them with grinding finality, sealing them in darkness. Aya's ears popped from the pressure change.
"No going back now," Amina muttered.
Chapter 21
The descent was immediate and steep, the carved passage so narrow their shoulders brushed both walls. The temperature plummeted with each step, their breath forming clouds in the suddenly frigid air. Somewhere far below, water dripped with metronomic persistence.
The rhythm wasn’t constant. Every few beats, the drip sped up, then slowed again, as if the mountain were testing a pulse. Aya felt it in the air too, a minute change in pressure that made her ears tighten and release, like the tunnels were breathing.
"Keep moving," Hamza urged from the rear. "These passages were carved to withstand siege engines and earthquakes, but Aegis will find other ways in."
The stone steps beneath their feet were worn to dangerous smoothness. Aya led by touch, her left hand on the wall, counting steps in the darkness until Karim's headlamp flared to life behind her, throwing long shadows.
Above them, muffled through tons of rock, came another explosion. The passage shuddered. Dust sifted from the ceiling.
"They're trying to blast through," Hamza said. "They won't succeed here, but they'll be searching for other entrances. My nephew knows to seal what he can and disappear."
The tunnel branched ahead. "Left where winter water speaks," Hamza said, taking the leftward path where a subtle chill in the air suggested hidden moisture. "Straight past the seven windows."
They moved quickly past a series of narrow vents cut high in the walls, ancient air shafts that connected to the surface far above, though no light penetrated their depths.
Hamza didn’t slow, but his voice dropped. “Listen to the water. Down here, passages don’t stay open just because someone wants them to. When the stone drinks, some routes close, some fill. We keep moving.”
As they descended, carvings began to appear in the walls. Simple scratches at first, then increasingly elaborate work. Some inscriptions were in Ottoman Turkish, others in scripts that Karim photographed without being able to immediately identify.
"Look at this," Amina said, stopping beside a particularly complex panel. Circles nested within eight-pointed stars, their edges marked with powder-fine graduations. "These match some of those astrolabe designs."
Her markings had begun to glow more steadily as they descended, turning her into a walking source of blue light. Under that illumination, faint pigments in the rock began to wake with traces of azurite blue and whispers of red ochre.
"The Silent Meridian," Aya said, studying the equations carved into the walls. "They didn't stop working when they lost the official observatory. They went underground."
She felt Hamza’s eyes on her as she uttered the words, but he remained silent.
"And they kept working for centuries," Karim added, photographing as he moved. "Look at the dates. Some of these inscriptions are from the 1570s. Others are much later. Generations of scholars adding to the same body of knowledge."
The passage opened suddenly into a larger space. They emerged onto a ledge overlooking what Aya's light couldn't fully illuminate, a vast chamber that swallowed their beams. The acoustics were unsettling. A boot scuff to the left would echo from high on the right; someone's breath would return as a chorus of whispers from multiple directions.
"As above, so below," Leyla said, her light finding the phrase repeated in various languages across the visible walls. Beside it, astronomical diagrams, mathematical proofs, and alchemical symbols.
The air shifted, a slow inhale through hidden fissures, and the dripping she’d been hearing all along swelled closer, more insistent, as if water were rising somewhere they couldn’t see.
"We need to keep moving," Aya said, though she ached to study it all. "Whatever's down here, Aegis can't find it."
Hamza led them along the ledge to a narrow archway. "The deep places I mentioned," he said. "Beyond this point, I've only been once. When my grandfather made me swear I would remember the path."
They passed through the archway into passages that grew older with each step. The Ottoman inscriptions gave way to symbols that predated even those. The air changed quality, growing cleaner, drier, and impossibly fresh for a space sealed for centuries.
"There," Hamza said finally, pointing ahead.
The passage opened into a spherical chamber that made Aya stop and stare.
It was perfectly round, as if they stood inside a stone planet. At least forty meters across, the walls curving into a high dome. Someone had hammered a heaven across that dome. Stars of silver and gold, constellations inlaid with copper wire, planetary tracks picked out in gems that fractured their flashlights' feeble beams into hard rainbows.
At the center rose a disk of polished obsidian, knee-high, black as a still pool. Silver lines ran across it like computer circuitry, measured paths joining shallow mounting cradles and precisely machined slots.
"Incredible," Hamza whispered. "I've never—" He caught himself, palm to his chest as if steadying his heart. "I've never been this far."
"It's beautiful," Karim whispered, stepping toward the platform before catching himself and glancing at Aya. She nodded once. Careful.
They fanned out slowly. Aya circled the wall clockwise, photographing inscriptions. Leyla took the opposite arc, her fingers hovering over engraved script. Karim crouched beside the platform, studying tick marks cut around its edge. Amina lingered near the entrance, eyes fixed on the ceiling.
"Look," Karim said, pointing to the marks. "These aren't ornamental. They're indices. Celestial positions." He angled his light, tracing patterns. "As above—"
"So below," Amina finished from behind them.
Leyla called out from her section of the wall. "This inscription. Old numbers I can't immediately decipher."
Aya crossed to her. The inscription sat chest-high in a band around a shallow recess, a braid of numerals and notational marks.
Leyla mouthed numbers under her breath, rechecking against a second line, then a third. "Sea-level," she said finally. "Not latitude-longitude. These are heights. Above the sea, then below again. Repeating on a cycle."
Aya studied the pattern, counting under her breath. "Wait. Those intervals. Twelve hours, twenty-four minutes between peaks. That's not geographic, that's temporal."
"Temporal what?" Leyla asked, though understanding was dawning in her expression.
"Tidal," Aya said. She turned to Amina, who had moved closer. "These are tide calculations."
Amina's face lit with recognition. "Like Maya Bay."
"Exactly like Maya Bay." Aya felt the familiar current between them, the way they'd once moved through problems like two parts of the same mind. "The hidden shrine. It was only accessible—"
"—during the low tide window," Amina finished, already pulling out her phone. "Forty-seven minutes twice daily when the water level dropped enough to expose the entrance."
"And we almost missed it because we were using standard charts," Aya added. "The local fishermen had different measurements based on—"
"—on reference points that predated modern sea level changes." Amina looked up from her phone. "These numbers aren't using modern baselines either."
Leyla watched them, brow raised. "You two have done this before?"
"A few times," Aya said, deliberately not meeting Karim's gaze from across the chamber where he'd paused in his documentation. "Amina, what if these are calibrated to Ottoman-era waterlines?"
"Give me a second." Amina scrolled rapidly through databases on her phone. "Mediterranean sea level in the 16th century was approximately... Here. Fifteen to twenty centimeters lower than present day along the Turkish coast."
"So we adjust all these measurements down," Aya said, already doing the mental math. "And these hash marks between the numbers. Leyla, could those be quarter-tide indicators?"
Leyla studied them with fresh eyes. "Yes. They could be. Which means this isn't just tracking high and low, it's mapping the entire tidal cycle."
Aya traced the full sequence. "For timing something that needs to happen at a specific point in the cycle. A window that opens and closes."
"Just like the shrine," Amina repeated softly, and for a moment their eyes met. Aya saw dawn breaking over the Andaman Sea, salt water rushing through hidden channels, the desperate race against rising tides that had nearly drowned them both.
Karim cleared his throat from his position by the platform. His expression was carefully blank. "Tidal calibration against a moving reference."
Aya felt the distance between them, the crack that moments like this only widened.
Leyla ran more calculations. "Southwest shore… If you map Ottoman bearings to modern charts, that line lands on—" She stopped herself. "Coast. Warm coast."
"Bodrum peninsula," Aya said. "It has to be."
Chapter 22
While Leyla and Karim studied the tidal calculations, Aya circled the chamber's perimeter. More inscriptions revealed themselves with each step.
Diagrams showed underground complexes connected by water channels. Architectural plans. And in one alcove, a detailed illustration of a human figure with arms outstretched, spine aligned along carved channels. Lines radiated from the body to carefully drawn lenses and mirrors, each marked with dense notations.
Aya's chest tightened as she studied it. "A human conduit."
Amina had drifted to the diagram. "Like the door mechanism in Morocco."
The illustration was technical, not symbolic. Whoever operated this device wouldn't just be using it. They would become part of it.
Aya moved closer to Amina, close enough to speak without the others hearing. "We don't have to do this. If this device requires what I think it does—"
"I know what you're thinking," Amina cut her off, her voice steady despite the slight tremor in her hands. "And you're probably right. These marks, the way the artifacts respond to me—it's all connected." She met Aya's eyes. "But we both know I'm the only one who can make this work, if it comes to that."
The weight settled between them, and Aya felt something surface that she struggled to suppress. It wasn't the time. She had something good with Karim, and she couldn't risk everything they were working toward. But she couldn’t lose Amina either.
Karim's voice broke the moment. "Look at these grooves in the platform rim. The Pleiades marks are worn." He glanced at Aya. She gave him a small nod.
He pressed.
Something clicked deep beneath the obsidian. Above them, the metal heaven shivered, one constellation sliding a degree while others compensated. A corresponding segment of the ring rotated under Karim's hand.
"Hidden mechanism," he whispered.
"Try another," Aya said.
He pressed Deneb. A low clunk echoed. The dome's copper lines shifted again. On the third press, a panel near Aya's shoulder sighed open on perfectly balanced hinges, revealing a shallow alcove.
Cold air seeped out, smelling of cracked leather and ancient ink.
Aya peered inside without touching anything. A single bound folio wrapped in oiled cloth, and behind it a brass panel etched with geometric patterns.
"Documents," Karim said carefully. "And instructions."
"Photograph first," Aya said.
Karim documented everything, each corner checked, each detail preserved. The folio's cover was stamped 1658.
They gathered around as Karim gently lifted the wrapped bundle, setting it on the least dusty section of the floor. His gloved fingers found the edge of the oiled cloth, testing its integrity before peeling back the layers.
The folio beneath was bound in dark leather, tooled with the eight-pointed star pattern. Karim opened it with infinite care.
The first page was dense with script; ink faded to brown but legible.
In a clerk's crisp hand: Successful activation under last alignment. Luminous phenomena were seen as far as the upper vineyards. Decision: hide until we can be wise.
A second line below, different handwriting:
Coastal workshops complete what mountain chambers begin. The sea sets the clock we cannot command.
"A network," Karim said. "This place is the brain, and other places are the hands. One of those hands points west."
Leyla pulled out her phone, inputting the tidal calculations they'd decoded. "The numbers sit exactly on the Bodrum peninsula if you translate them forward."
"Another chamber in the tides," Karim said.
"How far?" Aya asked.
"Southwest coast of Turkey," Leyla said. "Maybe they scattered these chambers across the region in case one was compromised."
Aya nodded. "Süleymaniye Mosque, Cappadocia, Bodrum. A whole network."
Amina had not moved from near the platform. "I can feel the sea when you say that," she said quietly. "Salt air at the back of my tongue."
"Amina, don't touch anything," Aya warned.
But Amina was already stepping toward the platform, as if drawn by invisible threads. The blue fire in her arm blazed, visible even in the dim light.
"We have what we came for," Aya started. "Let's go."
Amina didn't seem to hear. She slid the glass fragment from her pack and hovered it above the central mounting cradle, her hand shaking.
"We have no idea what that'll do," Aya warned.
"It's already calling me," Amina said and placed it.
The chamber answered like a held chord freeing itself. Blinding light flowed from the fragment into the silver lines, a star going supernova in slow motion. The obsidian shifted by measured ticks. Above, constellations strobed. Sound layered, a low harmonic Aya felt in her throat, then another in her ribs, then a third that seemed to come from the mountain itself.
Amina grabbed the platform edge to keep from falling. Her eyes rolled back, exposing the whites.
"Amina," Aya said, rushing to her side.
Amina's voice came in pieces between the cadence of that deep music. "Salt. Incense. Ancient stones watching ships come in. Bells ringing in the wind—" She flinched, gasping. "Water that fills and empties and waits between. So clear. Turquoise. It's Bodrum."
Karim's phone was already out, recording what he could.
The platform turned another fraction, then something unlocked inside the dome. A second panel breathed open in the adjacent quadrant.
"Incredible," Karim said, moving toward it. "Another component."
Nestled in the revealed alcove was a brass and crystal assembly the size of two fists. The brass formed a skeletal framework, delicate as lacework, while multiple lenses of different colored glass were suspended within it at precise angles. Behind it, mounted to the alcove's rear wall, was a brass plate cut with slots and notches—a receiving array with six primary mounting positions and smaller sockets between.
"This one's different from the fragment and cylinder," Leyla said. "More complex. Look at the lens arrangement."
"The focusing array," Karim breathed. "If our theories are correct, this would be the primary lens group. The part that actually bends and concentrates the incoming energy."
Amina's vision had cleared. The constellation map on her arm flared brighter as she approached. "It knows me," she said. "Just like the others. But this one's stronger."
"Don't touch it yet," Aya warned, but she knew they couldn't leave it behind.
"If this is here and the tidal calculations point to Bodrum," Karim said, "then they distributed the actual components. Scattered them across multiple sites to prevent anyone from assembling the complete device, the Silent Meridian."
"Unless you had the necessary knowledge to find them all," Leyla added.
Aya opened her backpack, extracting protective cloth. As her fingers brushed the brass framework, she felt a subtle vibration, as if the component hummed at a frequency just below hearing. "We have to take this."
A sound cut through the chamber's harmony: a higher-pitched grind, methodical, coming from the corridor they'd used.
"They found us," Leyla said flatly. "Shit."
Hamza's face looked very old suddenly. "No one else can find this. I had no idea what I was helping protect."
"They have the state's resources," Aya said. "Every sensor. Every tunnel map. We helped lead them here."
"We need to move," Leyla said.
The platform gave one last pulse that thudded through Aya's boots. From beyond the far wall, faintly, other notes answered.
Aya lunged forward and pulled the fragment free. The light didn't die so much as fold itself down. The obsidian stilled. The dome's starlight returned to its ordinary gleam.
"Exit?" Amina asked, voice ragged.
Hamza shook his head. "I only know the way we came."
"That one's occupied," Aya said.
The grinding from the corridor grew louder. Voices became audible, barking orders in Turkish.
"Spread out," Aya ordered. "Look for seams, pressure points, anything unusual."
They scattered around the chamber's perimeter. Leyla attacked the wall nearest the corridor. Amina tried the section near the first alcove, pressing inscriptions in sequence. Nothing happened.
"There has to be another way out," Karim said, voice tight. "No one would build a chamber like this with only one exit."
Hamza stood in the center, turning slowly. "The stories never mentioned—they only said the stars would always guide us home."
A loud crash echoed from the corridor. They were running out of time.
"The constellations," Aya said suddenly, looking up at the dome. "Karim, when you pressed those stars before, the whole system shifted. What if there's a specific sequence that opens an exit?"
Amina glanced at her arm. "The platform. It's still active somehow. I can feel it."
Karim, half-crouched over the platform rim, swore under his breath. "Look at Orion now." He pointed up. The hunter's belt had shifted with the last rotation, and where his shoulder star had been dull, it now showed a bright, polished gem with a tiny channel beneath it.
"Counter-release," he said. "If you align the Pleiades and Deneb in this order, Orion returns to winter position and—"
"Just do it," Amina said, already moving. She reached the shoulder star, finding the gem's polished surface was a grip. She pressed and slid it along the minute channel.
A seam in the wall became a line, then a crack, then a panel swinging inward on stone pivots so perfectly balanced the door moved with a breath. Cold air beyond. A slate-black passage.
Hamza was frozen. "But no one knows these routes. Not me. Not my ancestors. Not anyone."
"We do now, and they will soon," Aya said. "I'm sorry, Hamza, but we need to go. If we're already gone, maybe they won't damage anything here. Once we stop Aegis, we'll do everything we can to protect this work."
Hamza met her eyes, and in that moment, he made a decision. He stepped closer, lowering his voice so only she could hear. "Your father. He was an archaeologist, yes?"
"Yes."
"Leyla told me he died trying to protect sites like this from people like Malik. Maybe just like Emre." Hamza's hand gripped her shoulder. "I see this in you, too. Not fear, but the principle beneath it."
Aya opened her mouth but paused. "I'm not—I haven't always been someone who protected things."
“My family guarded these secrets by hiding for fifteen generations,” Hamza said. “That era is over. They have drones, sensors, maps, and resources my ancestors never imagined. You can move in the world they control. I can’t. So yes, if anyone carries this now, it’s you.”
The voices in the corridor were closer now, echoing off the stone.
“I don’t know if I’m the right person to carry it,” Aya said.
"Worth isn't about what you have been," Hamza said. "It's about what you will choose to do when it matters most." He released her shoulder, stepping back. "I believe Çelebi and his followers scattered these components because they believed some knowledge should be earned, not stolen. They would have wanted someone like you to find them. To understand them and make the right decision for humanity."
Aya looked into his eyes, feeling the weight of a burden that had passed for generations. A burden her father had likely died for. "I won't let them turn this into a weapon," she said. The words felt like an oath. "Whatever we discover in Bodrum, whatever the complete device can do, we'll make sure it's used wisely. Or not at all."
Hamza nodded slowly. "Then the guardianship passes to you. When this is over, when Aegis is defeated, come back. Help me preserve what's here. Not hidden, but protected. Shared with those who will honor it."
"I will," Aya said. "I swear it."
A smile creased Hamza's face, decades of worry easing slightly. "Then go. The mountain will keep its secrets a little longer."
The emergency passage was claustrophobic, barely shoulder-width, built to empty a room in an emergency, not to impress. Irregular steps alternated with steep rock slopes. Twice, the floor broke into waist-deep trenches they had to jump.
Behind them, light strobed from the chamber until it faded to complete darkness.
They ran by the only clock that mattered: the mountain's breath and their own. The passage dropped into a chute that burned Aya's forearms as she controlled her slide. They landed in a lower corridor where the air moved with purpose and smelled faintly of goat.
The world above, somewhere ahead.
Chapter 23
The emergency passage spit them out into predawn darkness, lungs burning, legs shaking from the climb. They'd emerged behind what Hamza identified as an abandoned shepherd's hut carved into the hillside, another remnant of his family's network, forgotten by everyone except those who knew to look for it.
Aya dropped her pack inside the hut's entrance and bent double, hands on knees, forcing her breathing to steady. The wound in her side pulled with each inhale, the stitches Amina had sewn protesting the abuse. Around her, the others collapsed against stone walls, equally spent.
"We're clear," Leyla said from the doorway, scanning the ravine below with night-vision binoculars she'd pulled from her pack. "No movement. No lights."
"They'll still be after us," Amina said through deep inhales. "They always are, but at least we’re ahead of them for now."
"Then we use the time we have," Aya said, straightening despite her body's complaints. She moved to the narrow window slit, looking out over the dark expanse of Cappadocia's valleys. Somewhere out there, in the maze of fairy chimneys and hidden chambers, was another piece of Çelebi's puzzle. 
Another satellite workshop, another place for Çelebi’s followers to gather and work in private, after the mosque in Istanbul and the star chamber they'd just escaped, plus whatever awaited them in Bodrum. They needed them all to assemble the complete Astral Lens back in Istanbul, to understand what they were dealing with, to prevent Malik and Aegis from having the Astral Lens, and to understand what her father had learned.
But first, they needed to rest. And think.
Karim spread his jacket on the dirt floor and sat heavily. "How long do we have?"
"Two, maybe three hours until dawn," Hamza said, checking his watch. "After that, the sun angle we need will only last twenty minutes before it shifts too far."
"Sun angle?" Karim asked.
"For the markers," Hamza explained. "The stories speak of finding the shepherd's path when the seven sisters dance with the wandering stars." He glanced at the artifacts in Aya's pack, their faint glow visible even through the fabric. "I think it describes a specific time that reveals the way forward. The Pleiades and the planetary positions, illuminating what's been hidden."
Aya pulled the glass fragment from her bag, watching it pulse with soft blue light in the darkness. It was responding to something, even now. To their proximity to the next site, perhaps, or to Amina's presence. "So we wait for dawn’s approach, let the fragment guide us to the exact location, and hope we can get in and out before Aegis catches up."
"That's the only plan I see," Leyla said. “Then on to Bodrum and the coast.”
"Yet another very detailed, foolproof plan," Amina said, but without some of her usual bite. She looked exhausted in a way Aya hadn't seen before, not physically spent but hollowed out, as if something was consuming her from within.
Aya moved to sit beside her. "How are you feeling?"
Amina held up her arm. The blue constellations glowed faintly in the darkness, pulsing in rhythm with the glass fragment in Aya's hand. "A lot worse," she admitted quietly. "The burning hasn't stopped since we entered that chamber below. It's getting stronger, not weaker." She rubbed at the map of the night sky, grimacing. "Like something is pulling at me. Or trying to pull something out of me. I don't know how to explain it."
"The connection to the artifacts?" Karim asked.
"Maybe. Or more djinn?" Amina's voice was uncertain. "In Morocco, I felt their presence like someone breathing behind me that I couldn't see. But now..." She shook her head. "Now it feels like something’s trying to push through. Like the marks are a door, and something on the other side is knocking harder and harder, and might rip me apart in the process. I don’t know if I’m strong enough for this."
The vulnerability in her words hung in the small space, reminding Aya of why she'd loved this woman once. Still did. It just had to be different now.
"Get some rest," Aya said, squeezing Amina's hand. "All of you. I'll take first watch."
"I'll stay with you," Hamza said. "These are my mountains. I should be useful."
The others settled into uneasy rest while Aya and Hamza maintained vigil at the window. The old man was quiet for a long time, his weathered face thoughtful in the darkness.
Eventually, he gestured toward the artifacts. "Knowledge is too dangerous to be hoarded but too valuable to be destroyed. That's a difficult balance."
"I'm not sure I know how to walk that line," Aya said. "I've spent my whole life taking things, selling them to the highest bidder. Now I'm supposed to be a guardian? It doesn't feel real."
"My family has protected these secrets for fifteen generations without understanding their purpose. Perhaps that was wrong. Perhaps the knowledge should have been shared, studied, and preserved openly. But we did what we thought was right." He met her eyes. "Now that burden passes to you. What will you do with it?"
Aya looked out at the predawn landscape, at the fairy chimneys rising against the lightening sky. "I swore to you I'd protect this. Not hide it, but protect it. Make sure it's either used wisely for good or not at all. I meant that."
"I believe you did."
They lapsed into silence as the sky gradually shifted from black to deep purple. Aya found herself thinking about her father, about the research that had consumed his final years. Had he stood in places like this, weighing the same impossible choices? Had he known, in Colombia, that his decision to hide rather than share could cost him his life? That it would leave her alone?
"The guardianship passes to you," Hamza had said in the star chamber. At the time, caught in the urgency of escape, she'd barely processed the words. Now, in the quiet before dawn, their full weight settled on her shoulders.
This wasn't just about stopping Aegis anymore. It was about deciding what came after. If they succeeded in keeping the lens from Malik, what then? They'd found two of Çelebi's workshops—the mosque in Istanbul, the star chamber below. They knew of a third in Bodrum. But then what? Find out how to safely destroy it all? Study it? Lock it away for another four centuries? Or assemble the lens themselves and find a way to use it that Hassan would have approved of?
"Movement," Hamza said softly, pulling her from her thoughts. He pointed toward the eastern ridge. "Dawn patrol. Probably on Aegis payroll if they’re moving with that much purpose."
Aya squinted at the distant figures picking their way along the ridgeline. Four of them, spread in a search pattern. They were still over a kilometer away, but the net was tightening. Either they'd predicted where the emergency passage would emerge, or they had more people than Aya had realized. Maybe both.
"Time to go," she said, moving to wake the others. "Sun's going to be up soon. If we're going to find this place, it has to be now."
They gathered their gear in tense silence, checking weapons, securing packs. Aya caught Karim's eye and saw her own determination reflected. He offered her a hesitant smile in return.
As they slipped out of the hut into the cold morning air, Aya looked back once at the small shelter that had given them a few hours of safety. Then she turned toward the fairy chimneys rising in the distance, toward whatever Çelebi and his people had hidden there four hundred years ago.
The artifacts pulsed stronger now, responding to the approaching dawn. Beside her, Amina sucked in a sharp breath and pressed her hand against her arm, where the blue marks flared brighter.
Hamza led them through challenging terrain, and Aya could feel the lack of sleep coursing through her body. Loose scree slithered underfoot with every step, each shift threatening to send them sliding down slopes that dropped away to nothing. Knife-edge ridges connected one precarious perch to another, with hundred-meter falls on either side.
Aya had taken two ibuprofen from Amina's kit, but they were barely touching the deep ache that had settled into her ribs. She pressed her hand against the wound, feeling the heat of inflammation through her shirt, but kept moving.
They were heading for a cluster of three fairy chimneys that appeared in Çelebi's workshop maps, though Hamza hadn't known their significance until now. The artifacts were leading them there, too, growing warmer and brighter with each kilometer they covered. Aya could feel the glass fragment's heat through her pack, pulsing in a steady rhythm. She couldn’t imagine how Amina must feel.
Halfway across a narrow ledge, Hamza's ankle rolled on loose stone. He stumbled, throwing his weight backward to avoid the drop. Karim moved instantly, sliding under the old man's shoulder without a word, taking half his weight.
"Easy," Karim said. "We've got time."
"Not much," Hamza grunted, but accepted the support.
They continued in silence, speaking only when necessary. The mountain carried sound with unnerving clarity. A cough or the scrape of a boot on stone could echo across the ravines like a gunshot. Somewhere behind them, Aegis was surely in pursuit, following whatever trail of disturbance they'd left in the star chamber.
Aya and Amina took point, scouting each section before waving the others forward. It was familiar work, the rhythm of movement and watch they'd developed in a dozen countries. For a few moments, they could almost pretend it was just another job, just another score.
Except Amina kept stopping every few minutes, pressing her hand against her arm, breathing through whatever sensation the marks were causing. Each time, the pause grew longer. Each time, the blue glow grew brighter.
"There," Amina said finally, pointing ahead with a trembling hand. "Three formations, arranged in a triangle. That's what we're looking for, right?"
Aya pulled up the photo on her phone, the one they'd taken of Çelebi's map in the underground workshop. The fairy chimneys matched exactly: three towers rising from the valley floor like ancient guardians, their distinctive caps eroded into shapes that might have been random but weren't.
"That's it," she confirmed.
They pressed on, descending into the valley proper as the sun climbed higher. By the time they reached the valley floor, the eastern rim was almost fully lit, throwing long shadows across the ground.
Three fairy chimneys rose ahead, big as lighthouses, their points like dark hats tipped against the sky.
"From the base," Karim said, already lifting his phone for a photo. "It resolves to an eight-pointed star. It has to."
"Wait," Aya said.
Her eyes tracked the slopes, the scatter of loose stones, the line where shadow gave way to light. The geometry they'd seen below ground, the Pleiades points and Orion pivot, had sketched a pattern into her head and refused to leave.
Amina stood still, eyes half-closed, as if listening for something that wasn't sound. The blue fire in her arm blazed now, visible even in the hint of daylight. She tilted like a compass trying to find north, and Aya fought the urge to wrap her arms around her for support.
"Here," Amina said softly, eyes still closed. Her voice was strained, barely controlled. "It's here. Right here. The pull is almost unbearable now." She opened her eyes, and they were glassy with pain. "Like the marks are trying to tear free. Like something is trying to claw its way out of my skin."
As they gathered around, the sun imperceptibly raised another degree. At that precise angle, a beam slid through an oval in the rock flank and painted a long rectangle on the ground below. The edges were too clean for an accident. The color of the dirt inside that bar of light ran just a shade warmer than the soil around it, and when Aya dropped a length of paracord with a carabiner as a plumb, the line cut the rectangle near the perfect center.
They didn't cheer. They knelt.
The top layer was a crust, easy to peel back with flat shards and a length of juniper root levered like a trowel. Under that, the soil came away. Concealment, not defense. Karim brushed carefully, fingertips and breath, revealing a ring of fitted stone as fine as anything in a museum.
"Every piece of this is surreal. I can't believe it," Karim said.
"Yep, still real history out there, doctor," Leyla said, wiping away the last of the debris.
A circular hatch lay beneath their hands, its face carved with astronomical marks so dense they seemed to drink the sun and hold it. Amina's blue marks, burning like smoldering coals, picked up the beam and answered with their own fire. She hissed, sharp and involuntary, more pain than surprise.
"No hinges," Karim said, following the edge with a knuckle. "No pry marks either."
Aya set her palm over the central sigil, depicting the eye with radiating lines that had followed them from the first time she'd seen it in her father's notebook.
It was as cold as river water. Nothing moved.
"Try the face, not the edge," Amina said, a little breathless. "It's a check. Not a lock."
Aya pressed again and held, feeling the grain of the carving. The rings on the stone rotated slowly, planets along a track, constellation marks sliding into alignment with their current sky. No clicks, no theatrics. Something inside acknowledged the position and slowly gave way.
As if on hydraulics, the hatch lifted weightlessly, revealing more darkness below, with only a spiral of handholds cut into the shaft.
"Down we go," Aya said, switching on her phone's light.
Chapter 24
They descended in the thin cones of light from Aya's phone, Karim's headlamp, Amina's small torch, and Leyla's phone. The stone absorbed the beams as the air grew thick, damp. Somewhere lower, water ticked like a metronome counting down their descent.
Amina's labored breathing echoed in the shaft above them. With each rung down, Aya heard her struggle, heard the small sounds of pain she was trying to suppress.
Whatever was about to happen, they were close now.
Very close.
The shaft opened into an antechamber barely large enough for all five of them to stand. Aya swept her phone's light across the space. The room was carved with precision, walls meeting floor at perfect ninety-degree angles. Drainage channels ran along the base of each wall. The air smelled clean, dry, impossibly fresh for a space that hadn't been opened in centuries.
Aya pushed through into the main chamber and stopped, her breath catching.
The workshop was circular, roughly fifteen meters across, with a domed ceiling that disappeared into shadow above their lights. The space felt less like a room and more like the inside of an enormous mechanism, every surface and element placed with calculated purpose. Workbenches lined the perimeter in a perfect circle, each station dedicated to a different stage of the lens-making process. Grinding wheels, polishing stations, calibration frames, all rendered in brass and stone and glass that caught their lights and threw back fractured rainbows.
"My god," Karim said through a gasp.
Aya moved deeper into the room, cataloging every detail. On one bench, optical instruments of staggering complexity: astrolabes with moving parts so fine they must have taken years to craft, measuring tools that looked more like jewelry than scientific equipment. On another, glass vessels of different shapes and sizes, each labeled in script with what she guessed were chemical formulas.
Manuscripts filled specially carved niches in the walls, protected in sealed leather that had hopefully kept air and moisture at bay for four centuries.
"Look at this," Karim said, his fingers hovering over a set of glass molds on one workbench. "These are negative crescents for grinding curved lenses." He shook his head in wonder. "This shouldn't exist. This level of optical engineering shouldn't have been possible without a computer."
But it was possible, Aya thought. Çelebi had figured it out, working in secret beneath the very institutions that would have executed him for heresy if they'd known. And he'd built this place to preserve that knowledge, to pass it on to whoever was meant to find it.
The room itself was a work of art, Aya realized. Not just the instruments it contained, but the space itself. It was the workshop of a genius who'd been four centuries ahead of his time.
Hamza positioned himself at the entrance, one weathered hand pressed against the stone frame. "I'll keep watch," he called. "Take what you need, but quickly. They won't be far behind."
For a moment, his silhouette seemed to merge with the rock itself, as if he'd been carved there centuries ago alongside Çelebi's secrets.
"My grandfather told me something," he said, not turning around, his voice carrying with resonance in the chamber. "About guardianship. He said the Silent Meridian had a rule: when the choice comes between protecting the knowledge or protecting yourself, you choose the knowledge. Always. Because guardians are replaceable. What we guard is not."
Aya felt coldness spread through her chest. "Hamza—"
"We're not planning on dying today," Karim said, voice falling flat in the stone chamber.
Hamza smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "No one ever does. But my nephew just radioed. Aegis vehicles are approaching from three directions with at least fifteen operatives. They're not coming to negotiate." He looked at each of them in turn. "So I'm asking: when the choice comes, will you choose as Hassan did? Or will you hesitate?"
Before anyone could answer, Mehmet's voice crackled over Hamza's radio, urgent and rasping: "Uncle, they're at the perimeter. Two minutes, maybe less."
Aya nodded, trying to pick up her pace. Every minute they spent here was a minute Aegis could use to close the gap. They needed to document, to understand, to take what they could, and then they needed to disappear before Malik's forces found this place, too.
But it was the center of the room that drew her attention most insistently.
At the heart of the chamber sat a platform of polished obsidian, its black surface inlaid with silver lines that formed an intricate geometric pattern. The design reminded her of the platform they'd seen, but more complex, more deliberate. Multiple cradles and slots had been carved into the surface at precise intervals, each one clearly designed to hold something specific.
"This is it," Leyla said, approaching the platform with careful steps. "The assembly point. Where all the components would have been tested together, a trial before bringing them out into the real night sky."
Aya pulled the glass fragment from her pack. Near the platform, it blazed with intense blue light. She moved to the obsidian surface, examining the slots, and found one that matched the fragment's dimensions perfectly.
"Here," she said, sliding the fragment into place.
The moment it seated, the fragment's glow intensified. The silver inlays in the platform beneath it began to illuminate, tracing pathways from the fragment outward in spreading branches of light. But the light stopped after only a meter, fading at points where other slots remained empty.
"Karim, the cylinder," Aya said.
He pulled the brass piece from his bag and examined the platform. Another slot, this one shaped for its dimensions. He placed it carefully, and the process was repeated. Light spread from it, tracing silver pathways, but again stopping at empty slots.
The platform hummed beneath their feet, a low vibration that Aya felt in her bones. But it was incomplete. Waiting.
"The glass fragment and cylinder fit perfectly, but the platform still needs more," Karim said, studying the empty slots around the perimeter. "Based on Hassan's component list, I'd guess those empty spaces are for the calibration rings, the focusing array, and the crystal heart. This platform isn't the lens itself; it's the key to unlocking the next cache where Çelebi hid more components."
Behind Aya, Amina shrieked.
Aya turned to see Amina standing at the platform's edge, frozen. The blue marks on Amina's arm blazed with the same intensity as the pieces they’d inserted in the platform assembly. And the platform was responding. The silver inlays nearest to Amina began to glow brighter, pulsing in rhythm with her marks.
"Amina?" Aya asked carefully.
She took a step back, but the platform's response only intensified. Blue light erupted from its surface, visible pulses that kept the rhythm of the marks on her skin. The silver inlays began to shift, rearranging themselves into new patterns. Into script.
"It's reacting to you," Leyla said, moving closer to read the emerging symbols. "It's... writing something."
The script continued to form, flowing across the obsidian surface like liquid silver, solidifying into language. Leyla knelt beside the platform, her fingers tracing the air above the symbols, translating as they appeared.
"'The touched must choose,'" she read aloud. Her voice grew quieter as she continued. "'The vessel must be purified. Only the willing sacrifice can unlock the guardian's gift.'"
The words hung in the air, heavy with implication.
Karim's eyes widened. "It's a security system," he said slowly. "Çelebi designed it to only open for someone who's touched this supernatural power. Only one of his followers that he’d already shown and worked with. So if anyone ever came back and accessed his work without him present, this would guarantee they’re one of his close confidants. It's—"
"A test of intent," Hamza finished from the doorway. "To prove you seek knowledge, not power. That you're worthy of what he's hidden here. That Çelebi trusts you. But he never accounted for someone coming with djinn energy; he only considered the energy from his own Astral Lens, but they appear to work the same."
Everyone turned to look at Amina.
She stood perfectly still, staring at the platform. The blue fire on her arm was so bright now that Aya could barely make out the individual constellations. Amina's face had gone pale.
"Amina," Aya said softly, taking a step toward her.
"I can feel it," Amina whispered. Her eyes never left the platform. "It's... calling to me. Pulling at the marks. At what's underneath them." She finally looked up, meeting Aya's eyes. "It wants to complete a transformation. To purify me of this curse."
"Purify how?" Karim asked.
Amina moved closer to the platform, drawn by something she couldn't resist. Her hand reached out, hovering over the obsidian surface. The moment her fingers came within inches of it, she cried out softly and jerked back.
"It showed me," she said, her voice trembling. "In that touch. It showed me what it wants to do." She cradled her marked arm against her chest. "The connection. The sensing ability. Everything the djinn gave me when they marked me in Morocco. It wants to burn it out. Extract it. Purify me back to what I was before."
The implications settled over the group.
"You'd lose it," Aya said. "The ability to sense the artifacts. To feel when they're near."
"All of it," Amina confirmed. She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "I'd be useless in this quest."
"You've never been useless," Leyla said firmly.
But Amina wasn't listening. Her eyes had gone distant, calculating. "And the energy release. If this is anything like what happened in the star chamber, the pulse would be—"
"Massive," Karim finished. "They'd feel it across the entire valley. Maybe farther."
"Aegis would know exactly where we are," Amina said. "They'd be on us in minutes."
Aya watched her friend process it all, saw the understanding dawn in stages. This wasn't just about losing an ability. It was about becoming the reason Aegis found them. About sacrificing the one thing that had made her indispensable to their mission. About choosing between who she'd become and what they needed.
"There has to be another way," Aya said. "We can—"
"There isn't another way," Amina interrupted. Her voice was flat, resigned. "We all know it. This is Çelebi's final test. The ultimate security measure. You want his most dangerous knowledge? You prove you're worthy by giving up any dangerous power of your own."
She looked around the workshop, at the instruments that represented centuries of genius, at the slots in the platform still waiting to be filled. Then she looked at her arm, at the marks that had tortured her for months.
"I should want this," she said quietly. "I've spent every day since Morocco hating these glowing tattoos. Wishing they'd never touched me, that they'd just disappear." Her hand traced the glowing patterns. "But now that I might actually lose them..."
She trailed off, and Aya saw the conflict playing across her face. The admission she didn't want to make.
"They made you feel special," Aya said softly, understanding.
Amina nodded, not meeting her eyes. "I've spent my whole life being good at things. Being useful. Being the one who could do what others couldn't. And these marks?" She gestured at her arm. "They made me essential. Irreplaceable. You needed me because of what I could sense, what I could feel that none of you could, even if you all had moral high ground on me." Her voice cracked slightly. "Without them, I'm just... maybe not enough."
"That's bullshit," Karim said, surprising everyone with the force of it. "You've been essential to this team from the beginning. Your tactical skills, your combat training, your ability to read situations—none of that came from this curse that you’ve carried. That's all you."
"He's right," Leyla added. "The marks are a tool. But you're the one who knew how to use them. There's a difference."
Amina looked at Aya, searching for something. Confirmation. Permission. Absolution.
Aya moved to stand directly in front of her, taking both her hands. "You matter without them," she said, holding Amina's gaze. "You always have." She squeezed her hands gently. "But I also won't pretend this doesn't cost you something. Risk something. It does. And if you don't want to do this, we'll find another way. Even if it takes longer. Even if it's harder."
"There isn't another way," Amina repeated. She looked at the platform, then back at Aya. "And even if there was, we don't have time. Aegis is closing in. This is the mission. This is what we came for." She took a shaky breath. "But I need you all to know that I'm scared. Not of the pain, but of what comes after. Of who I'll be without this, what it might take from me in the process. Of whether I'll still matter."
"You'll always matter to all of us," Aya said, her voice firm over the fears she suppressed.
Amina held her gaze for a long moment, then nodded slowly. She pulled her hands from Aya's and turned to face the platform.
"Okay," she said, her voice steadier now. Decision made. "I'll do it."
Across the workshop, Karim had drifted toward an astrolabe. His hand hovered over its brass surface, but he wasn't really seeing it. He was watching Amina steel herself, watching her prepare to sacrifice something irreplaceable.
This was the discovery of a lifetime, he thought. This workshop, these instruments, the knowledge contained, should be preserved, studied, and shared with the world. He'd become an archaeologist to protect exactly this kind of history, but they were here to take what they needed and likely lose the rest to Aegis. Or destroy it themselves to keep it from becoming a weapon. His dreams of scholarly study and academic recognition seemed small and selfish next to what Amina was about to do.
She was giving up power. He was mourning knowledge. But maybe they were both learning the same lesson, that some things mattered more than what you wanted for yourself.
His eyes landed on a small brass wafer tucked beneath a folded note on a nearby shelf. Later. That decision could come later. Now, they needed to help Amina through what came next.
"How do I do this?" Amina asked, staring at the platform.
"The center," Leyla said, reading the continuing script. "You stand in the center, and it will do the rest. But you have to choose it. Consciously. It has to be willing."
Amina nodded. She rolled up her sleeve fully, exposing the marks from wrist to shoulder. They blazed in the dim workshop, beautiful and terrible.
She stepped onto the platform.
Chapter 25
The moment Amina’s feet touched the obsidian, the entire surface erupted with light. The silver inlays blazed white-hot, tracing pathways from the edges toward the center where Amina stood. The glass fragment and brass cylinder in their slots flared to blinding intensity. And beneath it all, the platform began to hum, a deep, resonant tone that seemed to whir as it echoed off the stone walls.
"I'm here," Aya said, moving to the platform's edge. "We're right here with you."
Amina looked at her and smiled, though her eyes were already tightening with pain. "Always the hero," she said. "When did that happen to us?"
"We grew up a bit," Aya said.
The platform's hum intensified, rising in pitch. The light beneath Amina's feet began to swirl, patterns forming and reforming, like the rotating earth. And then it began.
Amina's back arched, her mouth opening in a gasp that became a cry. "Oh god," she managed. "It's—"
Blue fire erupted from her arm, shooting upward in brilliant streams. 
For a moment, Aya wasn't in Cappadocia at all. She was back in the Atlas Mountains, watching blue fire pour from Amina's body as their guide Abdelatif stepped into the stream of djinn energy. She'd reached for him, and her fingers had closed on empty air as he was pulled toward the Amulet. The look on his weathered face: peaceful, resigned, knowing. She'd screamed his name as the artifact imploded, as crystal shards tore through him, as he fell. She'd pressed her fingers to his wrist and felt nothing. No pulse. Just silence and the mountain collapsing around them.
Not again. She couldn't lose someone else to these ancient powers, not Amina, not like this.
"We're right here with you,” Aya called.
Rather than manifesting as semi-corporeal djinn, the platform was drawing the energy from her marks like venom from a wound, transferring it downward through the obsidian.
"Talk to me," Aya urged, moving closer despite the heat radiating from the platform. "Tell me what you're feeling."
Amina's jaw locked, muscles cording in her neck as she fought to form words through gritted teeth. Her back arched violently, vertebrae cracking audibly as her spine bowed beyond natural limits. "Hooks—" The word came out strangled.
Her fingernails scraped against the obsidian, the keening screech of keratin on stone, and then they cracked, one after another, as she clawed for purchase against something only she could feel. Sweat poured down her face, mixing with tears, dripping onto the obsidian where it sizzled and evaporated instantly.
"Like hooks. Dragging through every vein. Every capillary." The blue fire intensified, no longer just flowing from her arm but erupting from it in violent bursts. Amina's forearm rippled, the skin moving as if something living writhed beneath. The constellations weren't just fading; they were moving, migrating down her arm toward her wrist like a time-lapse of a night sky, gathering at the point of extraction.
A sound finally tore from her throat, a raw growl that raised every hair on Aya's arms. Amina's free hand shot out, fingers digging into her marked arm hard enough to leave crescent-moon indentations, trying to hold something in that was determined to get out.
"And it doesn't—" Her words fractured mid-sentence as her whole body convulsed again. Her shoulders jerked forward, then back, puppet-strings cut and retied in rapid succession. "It doesn't want to go."
The blue streams of energy flowing from her arm intensified. The obsidian was drinking them in, channeling them toward compartments that were beginning to open around the platform's perimeter. Their guesses were right. To access the next piece of Çelebi's power, power had to be paid.
"Keep talking," Aya urged. "Stay with me."
"It's like—" Amina's voice broke as another convulsion shook her. "Like something being extracted through my skin. Layer by layer. The djinn presence, the connection, all of it." Tears streamed down her face, carving tracks through the sweat. "The noise in my head, the constant awareness that something else was there, it's going silent. I can feel it leaving."
Her legs buckled, and she dropped to her knees on the platform. The blue fire intensified, and now Aya could see that the marks themselves were changing. The vivid blue was fading, being replaced by silver-white scars that no longer glowed but still spread from her wrist upward like frost.
"In Morocco," Amina gasped, "when the djinn marked me, it was fire. Burning from the outside in." Her words came between ragged breaths. "This is something being torn out of me. This is—fuck—this is worse."
But even as she said it, something shifted in her expression. Beyond the pain, there was relief. Wonder. The constant buzz she'd lived with for months, the presence that had invaded her mind and body, was finally going silent.
The platform had channeled the extracted energy into the hidden compartments, and at the center, a crystalline element that caught the blue light and fractured it into a thousand colors.
The hidden compartments held their secrets no longer.
Two metal rings lay nested in the first alcove, each roughly the diameter of a dinner plate but impossibly light when Aya lifted them. As if they were hollow, though they rang solid when she tapped them. The metal itself was unlike anything she'd seen: not quite bronze, not quite gold, but something between, with a faint iridescence that shifted in the blue light. One ring bore engravings so fine they were almost invisible until the light caught them. The phases of the moon were traced in microscopic detail around its circumference, with notations in what looked like a cipher beneath each phase. The other ring showed planetary orbits, nested circles with gemstone markers for each wandering star, all emanating from a central sun symbol that had been inlaid with actual gold.
"These are calibration rings," Karim said, kneeling beside Aya to examine them. "Look. They're meant to rotate independently." He demonstrated without touching, tracing the air above where one ring could theoretically nest inside the other. "You'd align specific celestial positions to calibrate the focal point.”
The crystalline element sat in the central compartment, protected by layers of oiled silk that crumbled at Aya's touch. The crystal itself was flawless, roughly the size of her fist, multifaceted with clearly deliberate cuts, each angle calculated to refract light in specific ways. When she lifted it, it caught the dying blue glow from the platform and exploded it into a spectrum that painted the workshop walls in rainbow fire. But more than that, it hummed. A vibration so subtle she felt it in her teeth more than heard it, a frequency that resonated with something deep in her chest.
"The focusing heart," Karim breathed. "This would sit at the lens assembly's center. All the collected energy would pass through here before—" He stopped, realizing the implication. "Before channeling into whatever serves as the conduit. I think that’s the last piece we’re missing."
They uncovered a scroll next, rolled tight and sealed with wax that bore Çelebi's personal mark, the eye within radiating lines. 
Leyla carefully broke the seal, unrolling just enough to glimpse its contents: detailed assembly diagrams showing how each component they'd found nested together, plus notations for pieces they hadn't yet recovered. Material specifications were listed in three languages. And in the margins, warnings. The same phrase repeated throughout: "Only when the stars decree. Never before. Never after."
The marks on Amina's arm completed their transformation, the last traces of blue fading to permanent silver-white. The patterns remained, but they were inert. Dead. Beautiful but powerless.
Amina cried out one final time, not quite a scream but a moan. Her whole body shook with the force. And then, suddenly, it was over.
The blue fire cut off abruptly. The platform's hum dropped to a low vibration, then silence. The blinding light faded to a soft glow.
And then came the pulse.
One moment, the platform was merely glowing; the next, every hair on Aya's body stood straight up, reaching toward something building in the air above them. A pressure formed behind her eyes, in her sinuses, in her teeth—an electromagnetic potential looking for ground.
The taste of copper flooded her mouth, sharp and metallic like the air before a lightning strike. The workshop's ambient light took on a strange quality, shadows bending at inconsistent angles, as if the physical space itself was warping around the gathering energy.
Then the platform's hum shifted. Not louder, but deeper, dropping below the threshold of hearing into something felt in bone and marrow. The obsidian beneath Amina began to glow from within, not surface illumination but internal fire rising from impossible depths as its silver inlays went white-hot, blazing afterimages into Aya's vision.
Another pulse erupted outward in a sphere of blue-white incandescence, a shock wave of pure energy. Aya felt it move through her. Through skin, through muscle, through bone, a current that made every nerve fire at once. Her vision whited out. Her lungs seized. For one impossible heartbeat, she could sense the mountain itself: the weight of stone above, the network of passages threading through rock, the ancient water channels and sealed chambers, all of it illuminated by the pulse as it expanded at the speed of light.
The workshop walls vibrated at a frequency that made her inner ear revolt. Dust jumped from every surface as the shock wave passed, creating a momentary fog of suspended particles that glowed in the aftermath. Glass vessels on the shelves rang out in harmony, a choir hitting a single perfect note before spontaneously shattering.
Another sound hit a second later with a pressure wave that made her ears pop painfully, and her vision swim. She staggered, throwing an arm out to catch herself against a workbench. Beside her, Karim dropped to one knee, hand pressed to his temple. Even Leyla, trained field operative that she was, reeled from the intensity.
Then it was gone, the energy dissipating into the rock, into the valley, into the sky above, radiating outward to any instrument sensitive enough to detect it. The mountain groaned around them, settling after being shaken to its foundations. Small stones pattered down from the ceiling joints. And in the sudden, ringing silence, they could all feel it: the certainty that they'd just announced their exact location to anyone who was listening.
"What have we done?" Hamza said from the doorway, his voice hollow with fear. "They'll have felt that across the entire valley. Maybe the entire region. The ones who are digging can track us here."
As if to confirm his words, a distant thud echoed from somewhere above them. Then another.
"We have minutes," Leyla said, already moving to gather the revealed components. "Maybe less."
But Aya's attention was on Amina.
She had collapsed onto the platform, gasping, her marked arm cradled against her chest. The silver-white patterns caught the remaining light, but they were lifeless now. Decorative. The living fire that had animated them for months was gone.
Aya knelt beside her. "Hey. Look at me."
Amina lifted her head, and Aya saw something she hadn't seen in months. Peace. Exhaustion and grief, yes, but underneath it all, peace.
"It's quiet," Amina whispered. Her voice was full of wonder and loss in equal measure. "God, it's fucking quiet. I forgot what this felt like." She touched her arm with her free hand, tracing the now-inert patterns. "No burning. No pulling. No sense of something else breathing behind me." She laughed, and it caught halfway between relief and sorrow.
"You did it," Karim said gently, standing nearby. "You got us through. Thank you."
Aya pulled the glass fragment from its slot in the platform and held it close to Amina, testing.
Nothing.
No flare of recognition. No response from the marks. No sense of connection. It was completely gone.
"I can't feel it anymore at all," Amina said, staring at the fragment in Aya's hand. "Any of it. The artifacts, the energy, the direction they were pulling. It's all just... silent." She looked up at Aya, and her eyes were wet. "I'm free. But I'm also—"
"You're you," Aya interrupted firmly. She pulled Amina into an embrace, holding her until the shaking stopped. "You're exactly who you've always been. The marks never defined that."
When she let go, Amina was steadier. Still overwhelmed, still processing, but whole.
"Well," Amina said, trying for her usual irreverence and almost succeeding, "that sucked. But at least I'm not glowing like a spotlight anymore."
Another thud from above, closer this time.
"They're coming," Hamza said urgently. "They followed the pulse. We need to move. Now."
Aya pulled the two metal rings from the platform's compartments, testing their weight. Impossibly light, impossibly precious. She turned to Karim, who was still cataloging the workshop's instruments, fighting the need to flee.
"Here," she said, pressing one of the calibration rings into his hands. "Keep this safe. If we get separated, at least the rings will be in different hands."
Karim wrapped it carefully in a cloth from his pack, his fingers lingering on the engravings. "If anything happens—"
"Nothing will happen," Aya interrupted, though they both knew it was a lie they needed to tell. “But just in case.”
She turned to Amina, who was still sitting on the platform's edge, exhausted but alert. Aya held out the crystalline element. "Can you carry this?"
Amina looked at it, at the facets that caught and fractured light, and something flickered across her face. Loss, maybe, or grief for the connection she could no longer feel. But she took it, wrapping it in her own cloth and securing it in the inner pocket of her jacket. "Even distribution," she said. "Harder to lose everything at once."
"Exactly," Aya said, keeping the glass fragment and the second calibration ring for herself, tucking them securely into separate exterior pockets.
Leyla rolled the charts tight, securing them with a leather strap before tucking them inside her jacket. "I’ll guard these with my life. These are critical," she said. "Assembly instructions. Material specifications. We lose these, we may as well lose everything."
Karim wrapped the brass cylinder in cloth, double-checking the seal before placing it into a pocket next to the fragment. His hands moved mechanically, efficiently, while his eyes remained fixed on the workshop around them.
Karim hesitated by a shelf where instruments lay in careful rows. His eyes landed on a small brass-colored wafer tucked beneath a folded note of impossibly intricate geometric assembly. The handwriting was Çelebi's own. He'd studied enough samples to recognize it instantly. Three lines, but he could only make out a reference to “stabilization.”
His hand moved before his mind caught up with what he was doing.
The wafer was roughly the size of a large coin and covered with engravings so fine they could only be read in bright light. Geometric patterns radiated from a central aperture, a hole precisely drilled through the wafer's heart. Around its edge, more of Çelebi's cipher, and beneath it, that note in the astronomer's own hand.
It appeared to be made of brass at first glance, but it was impossibly heavy and malleable in Karim’s hand. Constructed of a metal or material he’d never encountered, that the Earth had perhaps rarely encountered.
Karim tilted it toward his headlamp and translated from Turkish on his phone, squinting to make out the words:
"...primary assembly requires stabilization array. Without complete circuit, lens cannot maintain coherence beyond initial pulse. Catastrophic discharge inevitable if..."
The note cut off there, torn, or deliberately left incomplete.
He froze. This was a critical component, possibly the critical component that made the difference between controlled operation and catastrophic failure. The kind of piece that modern engineers would call a "single point of failure." Remove it, and the entire system could collapse. Or worse, explode.
And he knew he had to steal it.
The rationalization formed even as his fingers closed around the wafer: This is preservation. This is preventing a catastrophe. Their alliance was becoming increasingly unpredictable, and he was the only true historian with nothing to hide, no ulterior motive. He would have the final say on whether they used the lens or destroyed it. And if they had to destroy the lens, at least one piece could survive for study. I'm protecting knowledge, he thought.
But underneath the rationalization, a darker truth whispered: You're taking something they'll need. Something Amina just sacrificed herself to help you access. Are you no better than Malik? Do you truly not trust Aya? After everything?
The wafer was cool against his palm, surprisingly heavy for its size. The weight of guilt, he thought grimly. He glanced over his shoulder—Aya helping Amina, Leyla gathering charts, Hamza watching the entrance. No one looking his way. No one seeing.
The wafer slipped into his pocket. It sat there against his hip like a coal. The note's unfinished warning echoed in his mind: "Catastrophic discharge inevitable if..."
If what? If the stabilization array was incomplete? If pieces were missing?
Another impact from above shook the workshop, sending more stones cascading. No time to reconsider. No time to second-guess. The choice was made. He'd live with the consequences, whatever they were.
But the weight in his pocket felt less like preservation and more like theft.
Another blast shook, this one close enough that small stones rained from the ceiling.
"Now or never," Aya said. "We're out of time."
Down one wall, a panel carved with the Orion constellation hung a fraction looser than the rest. Aya touched the same stars she'd seen activated in the chamber before: Betelgeuse, Rigel, the belt stars in sequence, and the seam opened, obedient. The passage beyond ran narrow and sloped, the sort of artery built to move people quickly when there was no time for ceremony.
As they exited, Aya in the lead, the workshop's defense mechanisms activated behind them. Aya heard the moving parts even through the stone. Grinding wheels beginning to turn, shelves retracting into walls, documents being sealed away in hidden compartments. Without Hamza’s secrets, the room would protect itself, hopefully, and hide its most precious secrets, making things difficult for whoever came after.
But it wouldn't stop Aegis for long.
They ran in gasping silence, conserving breath, pushing through burning legs and aching lungs. The passage dropped twice in sudden slides that they had to control with braced legs and scraped palms, and rose once in a ladder of handholds that left Aya's fingers raw.
Then, ahead, a shift in the air.
"Junction," Hamza gasped. "Should be... just ahead."
The passage opened into a wider chamber where three tunnels branched in different directions. The air here moved with conviction, whipping in, sending Aya’s hair into a tangled swirl against her face.
They stumbled into the intersection, all of them breathing hard.
"Not much time for strategy," Aya said, smoothing her curls away from her face and pulling her hair into a ponytail. "They're going to be on top of us. We should split up and divide their forces for the best chance of success."
“Eastern shepherd passage points to Avanos,” Hamza said. “I’ll take Karim with me. I can navigate on instinct, and he can help me keep up the pace. You’ll each be fine on your own.”
"Western aqueducts push toward Nevşehir," Leyla added, eyes on the dark mouth of that passage. "I can get through a checkpoint on papers, no problem. And if they search me, I have the charts tucked where they won't think to look."
"Then we take south," Aya said. She looked at each of them in turn, knowing this might be the last time they saw each other for days. Weeks, if things went wrong. "Rendezvous in Bodrum. However, you can get there. We'll coordinate through Salah's secure channels."
The faint sound of wind carried down the southern passage, and with it a distant, rhythmic whooshing.
"Balloons," Amina said, catching the same sound. Her eyes brightened with possibility despite her exhaustion. "That's the propane burners. The dawn launches must be starting."
Aya listened more carefully. Amina was right. The distinctive roar of hot air balloon burners echoed faintly from somewhere above and south of their position. Rose Valley. The fairy chimneys, where tourist operators launched dozens of balloons every morning at sunrise.
"You're thinking what I'm thinking, habibi?" Amina asked, a familiar gleam of mischief cutting through her exhaustion.
Despite everything—the pain in her side, the weight of components in her pack, the sound of Aegis closing in—Aya grinned. "They'll be watching roads, airports, and bus stations. But balloon operators? Tourist flights over the valleys? Unlikely."
"It's brilliant," Karim said. "They launch from multiple sites, all within a few kilometers of here. Dozens of balloons in the air at once. Extremely difficult to guess and track which one you're in, even if they guess what you've done."
"And they cover distance fast," Amina added. “Twenty, thirty kilometers in a flight. Land somewhere remote, find ground transport from there."
"Most operators have launch sites in Rose Valley," Leyla confirmed. "If the southern cisterns connect to that area—"
"They do," Hamza interjected. "The water systems all drain toward the valley floor. You'll emerge somewhere near the launch fields."
From the passage they'd left, voices grew distinct. Turkish commands. The scrape of boots on stone. They were out of time.
Aya made the decision. "We take the southern route. Find a balloon crew, pay them for emergency transport. Or improvise if we have to."
"You mean hijack," Amina said with a half-smile.
"I mean improvise," Aya replied through her own rueful smile. "We're still good guys now, but we may have to blur a few lines." She gestured to the pack on her shoulder. "We're carrying the hardware. The lens components. If Aegis catches us here, everything's lost—including what Amina sacrificed to get us. The balloons get us out fast and clean."
Karim checked his phone. "Dawn launches usually start around 5:30. It's 5:17 now. They'll be in the air or about to launch."
"Then we move fast," Aya said.
Aya looked at the others one at a time. They were scattering like seeds on the wind, trusting that they'd all find their way to Bodrum and the coast.
Karim's hand found Aya's shoulder, and she covered it once with her own, interlocking their fingers, before letting go. The gesture said everything words couldn't: be careful, come back, we're not finished yet.
Amina pressed her fist against Leyla's. "Stay sharp."
"Always," Leyla replied. Then, softer: "Thank you. For what you did in there. For all of us."
Amina nodded, unable to speak past the emotion in her throat.
Hamza lifted his chin at Aya. Their eyes met, and in that weathered face she saw trust, belief, and something like pride. "The guardianship is yours now," he said quietly. "All of it. My family's burden, Hassan's legacy, Çelebi's secrets. You carry them forward."
"I won't let you down," Aya promised.
"I know."
Behind them, the sound of pursuit grew unmistakable. Flashlight beams swept the distant passage. Voices called out.
"Go," Aya said. "Now."
They didn't argue, didn't hesitate.
Chapter 26
The separation point felt like a physical severing. Aya watched Karim's flashlight bob away into the eastern passage, Hamza in front of him, their silhouettes shrinking until it was swallowed by the curve of ancient stone. Leyla's form disappeared into darkness within the western tunnel. Then there was only the sound of Amina's breathing beside her, the weight of the components they carried, and the knowledge that any of them could be walking toward capture or death.
"South," Aya said. "Stay close."
“You got it. Lead the way, girl.”
The southern cistern route proved mercifully short compared to the labyrinthine passages they'd navigated earlier. The air felt more connected to the outside world, carrying hints of the surface. Morning dampness, the smell of earth warming in early sunlight, traces of thyme from the scrubland above. They moved quickly through passages that showed signs of regular water flow, limestone worn smooth by draining water, and channels cut deep into the floor by patient erosion.
After a frantic sprint through narrowing passages, they encountered a vertical shaft where handholds had been carved into the rock at regular intervals, ascending toward a circle of pre-dawn gray far above. Morning light, faint but unmistakable, filtered down through what appeared to be one of the unmistakable fairy chimneys themselves.
"Up," Aya said, testing the first handhold. The stone was cold and slightly damp, but the holds themselves were deep and secure, cut by hands that understood what failure meant.
They climbed in silence, muscles burning from the overnight exertion. The circle of light above grew larger, brighter, revealing itself as an opening disguised by scrub brush that had been carefully arranged to hide it from casual observation.
Aya emerged first, pushing through the brush, and stopped with one leg still in the shaft.
They were standing inside one of the fairy chimneys. The morning light filtered through the opening above, illuminating walls that curved around them like the interior of a stone cathedral. The volcanic rock had been hollowed out centuries ago, hand-carved into a shelter or storehouse, and the erosion since had only made it more surreal. The walls bore the scraping marks of ancient tools alongside the smooth organic sculpture of wind and water, human intention, and geological time layered into the same surface.
Aya tilted her head back, following the curve of stone upward to where it opened to the sky. The opening framed a perfect circle of dawn, pale blue shot through with gold, a piece of heaven caught in rock. It felt less like emerging from underground and more like being born from the mountain itself.
"How many people over the centuries have used this exact escape route?" Amina asked as she pulled herself out beside Aya, brushing dirt from her jacket. She turned slowly, taking in the carved walls, the absurd beauty of their new hiding place. 
"And how many of them," Aya said, stepping fully out onto the sandy soil, "came out to this?"
She gestured toward the landscape spread before them, and Amina's words died.
The valley was alive with balloons.
Dozens of them dotted the sky at various stages of flight. Some were still tethered to the ground, being inflated, their envelopes fat and colorful against the pale dawn; others were already airborne, drifting at varying altitudes like massive jellyfish in an atmospheric ocean. The distinctive roar of their burners echoed across the valley, a rhythmic thunder that punctuated the otherwise quiet morning.
Amina emerged beside Aya, brushing dirt from her clothes, then stopped mid-motion as she took in the spectacle. "My God," she breathed. "It's—"
"Perfect cover," Aya finished, already scanning the launch area. The nearest operations were just over two hundred meters away across relatively flat ground dotted with scrub and the occasional fairy chimney. Most were large commercial outfits with ground crews managing balloons with baskets large enough for sixteen passengers and long lines of tourists waiting to take in the majestic view from the skies.
But off to the left, slightly separated from the main cluster, sat an almost isolated balloon. The company logo was emblazoned across the balloon and basket in loud green and orange text: "Kapadokya Dream Flights Premium Tours." Aya recognized the company from a series of billboards leading into Göreme. 
The basket could hold eight passengers easily, but it appeared all their other balloons had launched for the day already, so the remaining ground crew consisted of only one young woman managing the inflation fan and an older man checking the propane connections.
"That one," Aya said, pointing. "Come on."
She and Amina moved quickly across the open ground, staying low and using the scattered rock formations as cover where possible. The sound of balloons launching provided audio camouflage, the burners' roar drowning out the sound of their approach.
The woman looked up first as they approached, her expression shifting from surprise to alarm as she took them in. Disheveled, dirty, exhausted, desperate.
"Merhaba," Aya called. "I need you both to step away from the balloon."
The older man straightened immediately, his weathered face hardening. "No. Absolutely not." His hand moved toward the radio clipped to his belt. "Mehmet! We have a situation at—"
Aya pulled the gun from her waistband, not pointing it at them but letting them see it, letting them understand. The man stopped speaking immediately.
"Please don't make me do this. We're not going to hurt you, but we need your balloon."
"You're insane," the woman called out, her voice rising. She planted herself more firmly beside the basket, as if her body could protect it. "Do you know what this thing costs?"
"I can guess," Aya said. The weight of what they were doing settled heavily with each word. "And I'm sorry. We wouldn't be doing this if there was any other way."
The man's hand was still hovering near his radio. "There are controls everywhere, and tons of police around this morning. You'll never get away with this, even if you do know how to fly."
"That's exactly why we need to leave now," Amina said, moving forward with her own handgun visible. Her voice was harder than Aya's, more willing to play the role of threat. "The keys to the equipment trailer. Now."
"This is my job," the woman said. "Our whole—"
"Look, I understand," Aya interrupted, and she meant it. The gun felt wrong in her hand, heavier than it should be, carrying weight that had nothing to do with its physical mass. This was someone innocent whose life she was disrupting. "But right now, this second, people will die if we don't get out of this valley. Not might die but will die. That's not hyperbole."
The man studied her face, searching for the lie. Whatever he saw there—desperation, sincerity, the exhaustion that came from making impossible choices—made his shoulders sag slightly.
"You'll crash it," he said finally, quieter. "You don't know how to pilot a balloon."
"I've done it before," Aya said. It wasn't entirely a lie. She'd watched, she'd learned, she understood the principles. "I'll bring it down safely. I'll make sure you get it back."
The man fumbled with the keyring on his belt, his hands shaking with anger and fear. Amina took it gently, then gestured toward the equipment trailer. "Inside. Both of you. Sit down, stay quiet for twenty minutes, and you'll be fine. You'll walk away from this without a scratch."
"The company will sue you," the man said even as he complied, moving toward the trailer with his daughter beside him. "Full charges. Theft, assault with a weapon, endangering commercial aviation—"
"We'll take our chances," Amina said.
"Please," Aya added, softer, as the woman paused at the trailer door. "We'll do everything we can to return it safely. And when this is over, when you see the news, you'll understand why we had to do this."
“Oh, come on, this company has insurance,” Amina said. “It’s not like these two own the balloon.”
Aya shrugged. “We’ll do our best to get it back, but we need to take your company’s balloon now, and we need you to cooperate. Lives are on the line.”
"That's not how this works," the woman said, her voice tight with fear and anger.
"I know," Aya said quietly before exiting. "And I am sorry. It’s an emergency."
Amina secured the trailer door from outside with a length of rope, leaving it loose enough to ensure they'd be found easily once the launches were completed, but giving enough time for escape.
"Okay, let’s hope I can pull this off," Aya said to Amina as they moved to the balloon.
The man had nearly completed the inflation process. The envelope lay on its side, about sixty percent full, the fan still running to force cold air into the opening. The burner assembly was mounted above the wicker basket, which lay tipped on its side, attached to the envelope by steel cables.
"You've done this before?" Amina asked, studying the complex array of equipment with wide-eyed skepticism.
"Sort of," Aya said. "Once in Namibia on a heist that required aerial surveillance for three days before I moved on the target. I spent enough time with the pilot to understand the basics, and I’m naturally curious. I rode a balloon with my parents in New Mexico when I was a kid, too. Had a book about balloons from the library." She checked the burner. "The principles are pretty straightforward. Hot air rises, cold air falls. We control the altitude, not the direction. The wind controls the rest."
"That's reassuring. You know how much I love giving up control."
"We still have some, and it's going to have to be enough."
Aya checked the propane tanks—four of them mounted on the basket's frame, gauges showing roughly three-quarters full. Plenty for a flight of ninety minutes, maybe two hours if they were conservative. She examined the burner controls, finding the pilot light already ignited, a small blue flame waiting to be fed.
Around them, other balloons continued their launch sequences, ground crews shouting instructions, passengers climbing into baskets, cameras flashing as tourists captured the moment. No one was paying attention to their small operation on the edge of the launch area.
"Help me with this," Aya said, gripping one side of the basket. Together they heaved it upright, the wicker frame surprisingly heavy. The basket settled onto the ground with a solid thump, the burner assembly now positioned correctly above them.
Aya grabbed the blast valve, a simple lever connected to the propane feed, and pulled it down.
The burner roared to life, twin jets of flame shooting upward into the envelope's throat. The heat was instant and intense, a wall of thermal energy that made Aya's face feel sunburned in seconds. She held the blast for a full ten seconds, watching the balloon begin to stir and lift as hot air flooded into it.
"The ground crew usually holds it," Aya explained, releasing the valve. "But we don't have that luxury. Get in the basket. When it starts to lift, we go immediately."
Amina climbed over the edge, settling into one corner of the wicker basket with her pack. Aya followed, positioning herself near the burner controls. The basket rocked slightly as they moved, the envelope above beginning to rise, its colorful panels, red and gold in a diamond pattern, catching the strengthening dawn light.
Another blast of the burner. The envelope rose further, taking shape, the fabric going taut as pressure built inside. The basket shifted, lifted an inch off the ground, then settled back down.
Aya hit the burner again, holding it longer this time. The roar drowned out the distant shouting of the man and woman they’d locked inside their workroom. The balloon filled, becoming a perfect teardrop of heated air straining against the cables that connected it to the basket.
Chapter 27
The basket left the ground with a gentle, almost imperceptible lifting, like the earth deciding it no longer wanted to hold them. One moment they were on solid ground, the next they were six inches up, then a foot, then three feet, rising with a stately inevitability.
"Well, we're flying," Amina said, her voice caught between fear and wonder. “Good job so far, habibi.”
Aya blasted the burner again, adding heat, increasing their rate of ascent. The ground fell away beneath them with increasing speed. Ten feet, twenty, fifty. 
Members of other grounds crews were running toward them now, shouting and gesticulating, but too late, far too late.
Other balloons hung in the air around them at various altitudes, creating a scattered fleet of colorful orbs. Aya guided them into the middle of the cluster, using the other balloons as visual camouflage. From a distance, from the ground, they'd be just another tourist flight to Aegis operatives, indistinguishable from the dozens of others taking to the air for the dawn show.
Aya settled into the unique sensation of flight with no engine vibration, no wings to bank or tilt, no sense of speed. It was just a profound floating, as if gravity had simply forgotten them. The basket swayed gently, responding to air currents, the wicker creaking softly. Between burner blasts, the silence was absolute and startling.
Beneath them, Rose Valley spread in all its surreal alien beauty, as strange as anything Dali could dream up. Those distinctive cone-shaped rock formations that gave Cappadocia its otherworldly appearance stretched in every direction like a petrified forest. Erosion had carved the soft volcanic tuff into fantastic shapes: spires and pyramids, mushrooms and towers, each one unique, each one impossible.
Then the sun fully broke over the eastern horizon, and the world ignited.
Golden light washed across the valley, painting the pale stone in shades of honey and amber and rose. Shadows stretched long and dramatic, filling the spaces between formations, making the already complex topography into a three-dimensional maze of light and dark. The rock itself seemed to glow, the iron oxides in the tuff catching the dawn and reflecting it in warm tones.
"It's beautiful," Amina said softly, her hand gripping the basket's edge, knuckles white despite the wonder in her voice.
Around them, other balloons drifted at different altitudes. A red one above and to the left, its shadow passing over them. A small blue and white striped balloon was descending below them, beside a massive commercial balloon with sixteen passengers in its basket, all of them pointing cameras outward, capturing the dramatic scenery. The balloons moved independently, each one responding to slightly different wind currents, creating a slowly shifting aerial ballet.
Aya blasted the burner again, adjusting their altitude to match the larger balloons nearby. The heat from the flames was intense against her upturned face, a pocket of summer in the cool morning air. Between blasts, the temperature dropped noticeably, the altitude stealing warmth from the air.
They rose above the immediate valley next, giving them a panoramic view of the region. To the north, the town of Göreme spread across the landscape, its buildings nestled among more fairy chimneys, cave dwellings carved directly into the rock faces visible even from their height. To the south, Love Valley stretched with its distinctly phallic rock formations, morning light making them almost glow. To the east, Pigeon Valley twisted through the terrain, named for the thousands of pigeon houses carved into its cliffs by farmers who'd harvested the bird droppings for fertilizer.
The scale of it all was overwhelming. From ground level, the fairy chimneys were impressive. From above, the full scope of the geological phenomenon revealed itself. Thousands of formations covered hundreds of square kilometers. Centuries of wind and water had sculpted the landscape into something that belonged more to dreams than geology.
Aya checked the altimeter mounted on the basket's frame. They were at eight hundred meters now, higher than most of the other balloons, high enough that individual people on the ground were invisible, reduced to abstract dots moving through the landscape.
The wind at this altitude came from the southeast, gentle but persistent, pushing them toward the northwest. No way to steer, no way to change direction, they could only control whether they went up or down, and hope the wind at different altitudes might take them where they needed to go.
A radio mounted on the basket's frame crackled to life: "Dream Flights balloon, this is flight control. You are operating without clearance. We don’t have you scheduled to go up today. Identify yourself or return to the launch site immediately."
Aya ignored it without comment, reaching over to turn the volume down. They'd be tracked now, their position noted, but in the chaos of dozens of balloons in the air simultaneously, it would take time to coordinate any meaningful response.
Between burner blasts, the silence returned, profound and peaceful, broken only by the occasional creak of wicker, the whisper of wind against the balloon, the distant roar of other pilots firing their burners. 
As the minutes drifted by, on top of the world, it was easy to forget that they were fugitives carrying stolen artifacts, that armed operatives were hunting them, that they'd commandeered this balloon at gunpoint. Easy to just exist in the moment, suspended between earth and sky, drifting through one of the most beautiful landscapes Aya had ever seen.
For the first time in hours, they had a moment to breathe. No tunnels pressing in, no footsteps echoing behind them, no immediate threat demanding action. Just wind and silence and the strange peace of floating. Amina stared at her arm, at the silver-white marks that had replaced the burning blue. She traced one of the constellations with her finger. Her other hand gripped the basket's edge so tightly her knuckles had gone white, and Aya knew it wasn't fear of heights, it was something else.
"In Egypt," Amina said suddenly, her voice quiet enough that Aya almost missed it under the wind, "I left you because I was scared."
Aya's hand tightened on the burner control. She kept her eyes fixed on the horizon, on the distant mountains, anywhere but on Amina's face. "We've been over this for what feels like the hundredth time now."
"Not scared of them." Amina continued undeterred, turning so her back was against the basket's rim, so she was facing Aya fully, even though Aya refused to meet her eyes. "Of needing you. Of being that vulnerable. I realized that I wanted to abandon the job and save you, and that thought terrified me, so I did the opposite, and I’ve never stopped regretting it."
The words hung in the thinning air between them. Aya fired the burner, using the roar as an excuse not to respond immediately. Ten seconds of flame, ten seconds of deafening noise, her face tilted up toward the heat, away from Amina. When she released the valve, the silence felt even heavier than before.
"I ran because it was easier than staying," Amina continued. Her fingers traced the silver-white marks on her arm, a nervous gesture Aya recognized from a hundred previous conversations. "And I told myself it was tactical. That I was making the smart choice, getting clear before things collapsed completely."
Aya finally looked at Amina, and immediately regretted it. Amina's face was open in a way she rarely allowed, stripped of the usual armor of sarcasm and confidence. Vulnerable. Real.
"But the truth is," Amina said, her voice dropping even quieter, "I was terrified of how much I needed you. How completely you'd gotten under my skin." She laughed, but there was no humor in it. "At the idea that you might change me, that you were changing me, when I'd worked so hard my entire life to be exactly who I needed to be to survive."
Aya turned away again, studying the complex array of propane gauges, the altimeter, anything that wasn't Amina's face. Her chest felt tight, her breathing shallow.
"And now," Amina continued, and Aya could hear her shifting closer, could feel the warmth of her presence in the confined space of the basket, "I'm terrified for different reasons."
Aya’s body tensed involuntarily. "Don't."
"Because you're with someone who deserves you," Amina pressed on, ignoring the warning. "Someone who could give you the life you say you wanted. Stable, academic, building something that lasts." A pause, heavy with everything unsaid. "And I can't compete with that. I'm rougher around the edges. I'm the bad choice, the one to walk away from. But I know that I was wrong; I don’t need to be that person anymore. You were changing me, allowing me to grow and evolve beyond that hardened personality I created to survive."
"That's not fair," Aya said, her tone harsher than intended. She whirled to face Amina and found her closer than expected, close enough to see the flecks of gold in her dark eyes. "You can't just—"
"Love isn't fair," Amina interrupted, and her hand found the basket's rim near Aya's, not quite touching but close enough that Aya could feel the heat radiating from her skin. Close enough that moving an inch would bridge the gap. "But I'm still here. Still hoping you'll choose the life you actually live instead of the one you think you should want."
"What does that mean?"
Amina's eyes held hers with uncomfortable intensity, refusing to look away, refusing to let Aya escape. "The adrenaline. The danger. The never knowing what's coming next." She gestured around them. The stolen balloon, the impossible escape, the components they carried that could reshape the world. "That's who you are, Aya. That's what gets you going, what turns you on. You're not some professor's quiet, stable girlfriend cataloging pottery shards in temperature-controlled archives."
"You don't know what I want," Aya said, but the words came out limp.
"Don't I?" Amina's fingers shifted, brushing against Aya's knuckles. The contact sent electricity up her arm. "You come alive when everything's going wrong. When you're three moves ahead of whoever's chasing you. When you're stealing balloons at gunpoint and flying them over Cappadocia at dawn." Her voice dropped, intimate and certain. "It's messier, but fuck if it's not more exciting.”
"What does that mean?"
“It's who you are. It's who we are."
The silence between them stretched, filled only by wind and the distant roar of other balloons' burners. Aya couldn't look away from Amina's face, from the challenge and the plea mixed.
They were suspended in more than just air. Aya knew they’d had many approaches to this conversation, but this was it. This was a moment that would define everything that came after. Every choice, every relationship, every version of herself she'd become. She could feel it crystallizing, time slowing to allow her to choose which direction gravity would pull her.
Karim's face flashed in her mind. Good, steady, deserving Karim, who'd never asked her to be anything other than what she was. Who'd supported her, trusted her, followed her into danger without complaint, fighting to protect his dream of what they could build together.
And here was Amina, who'd left her bleeding in Egypt, who'd returned full of apologies and buried feelings, who represented every unstable, dangerous, exhilarating thing Aya had been trying to convince herself she didn't need.
Amina's hand was still there, close enough to touch, waiting.
Aya contemplated an answer, a refusal, a question, something that would break the moment and return time to its normal flow.
Aya opened her mouth to argue, to defend Karim and the future they'd discussed, but her body betrayed her. Her hand, which had been gripping the basket rim as an anchor, relaxed. Her shoulders, which had been squared defensively, softened. Her breath, which she'd been holding like a shield, released in a long exhale that carried more truth than any words could.
Images flashed unbidden: Karim in his element at a dig site, brush in hand, explaining pottery fragments with infectious enthusiasm. The gentle way he'd held her after they escaped the tunnels. The future he'd sketched for them, full of quiet mornings, academic conferences, a life built on scholarship and safety.
It was a good life, one she’d felt drawn to. A life many people would kill for, one she’d fought for, longed for.
But it made her chest feel tight, her lungs unable to fully expand.
She thought of the past seventy-two hours: the star chamber's discovery, Amina's sacrifice on the platform, the pulse of ancient power, this stolen balloon ride over an alien landscape. Her pulse had been elevated for three days straight. She'd stolen, lied, threatened people with guns, destroyed property, and fled from authorities. And she felt more herself than she had in a long time.
Her hands started shaking from the physical weight of recognition. That moment when your body knows a truth your mind hasn't caught up to yet. The vertigo of standing on an edge and realizing you've already been falling.
"Aya?" Amina's voice was softer now, concerned.
Aya looked down at her trembling hands, then at the artifacts in her pack, then at the impossible landscape spreading below them. She'd spent the last six months telling herself she wanted stability. She had let the idea take place in her mind, fueled by guilt, fueled by guesses about her father’s opinions of her life. But he’d been on this quest, too, in his own way. She convinced herself that she was tired of the chase, ready to settle, prepared to become someone who built rather than took. 
But her body was telling a different story. It always had been.
The adrenaline didn't terrify her. It clarified her. Made her sharper, faster, more alive. The danger wasn't something to escape; it was the element she'd been designed to move through, like a fish returned to water.
And Amina had always known this about her. Had seen it when Aya herself was still pretending otherwise.
Her hands steadied. The shaking stopped. Not because the truth had changed, but because she'd finally stopped fighting against its weight. 
Then, before she could speak, before she could give voice to the recognition burning in her chest, movement in the distance caught her eye. 
A helicopter, black and sleek, was rising from the valley floor to the north. It banked toward the balloon cluster with unmistakable focus. 
"Shit," Aya said. "Did they find us?"
Chapter 28
Aya's hand moved instinctively toward the burner, ready to add altitude, then froze.
"Wait," Amina said, tracking the helicopter's approach. "If they know we're in a balloon, we're already dead. A helicopter can outrun us, outmaneuver us, force us down anywhere they want."
Aya's mind raced through scenarios. "So either they don't know we're here specifically..."
"Or they're searching all the balloons." Amina squinted at the approaching aircraft. "Look at the pattern. It's not coming straight for us. It's weaving between balloons at a fair distance, checking each one."
She was right. The helicopter moved methodically, approaching one balloon, hovering briefly as whoever was inside examined it, then moving to the next. Systematic. Thorough. Not the behavior of a team that had already identified their target.
"They saw the pulse," Aya said, understanding clicking into place. "They know we're somewhere in this valley, probably guess we might try to escape by air, given the balloon launches. But there are dozens of balloons up here."
Amina nodded. "And we all look the same from a distance."
The helicopter was ten balloons away, working its way through the cluster. Close enough that Aya could see it was a civilian model, not military, which likely meant there was limited time before authorities questioned what they were doing, harassing tourist flights. And that Aegis hadn’t diverted many resources to the air. They didn’t actually believe they were in a balloon.
"Options," Aya said, thinking aloud. "We can go up, try to hide in the higher balloons, hope they check those last."
"Or?"
"Or we go down. Fast. Get out of the search pattern entirely, land somewhere they're not expecting."
Amina studied the approaching helicopter, calculating. "If we go up, we're trapped up here with finite fuel. If we go down, we're on the ground where they have vehicles, ground teams."
"But on the ground, we can hide, move, disappear into the terrain. Up here, we're sitting ducks once they narrow the search. And someone could always find the two we locked up."
The helicopter checked another balloon. Nine away now. They were probably photographing each basket, trying to identify passengers, looking for anyone matching their descriptions, or Karim’s or Leyla’s.
"Your call," Amina said. "You're the pilot."
Aya watched the helicopter move to the next balloon in line. She thought about fuel consumption, about how long they could stay up, about the odds of hiding in plain sight versus the odds of disappearing on the ground.
"Down," she decided. "We go down now, fast, before they get close enough to photograph us clearly."
"Then let's move."
"Hold on," Aya said, reaching for the red vent line, the parachute valve at the top of the envelope that would dump hot air and kill their lift.
She pulled it gently at first, just enough to feel the balloon respond. The rate of descent increased, the altimeter needle swinging counterclockwise with increasing speed. 
Eight hundred meters. Seven-fifty. Seven hundred.
They dropped past a large commercial balloon, its massive envelope blocking the sun for a moment, casting them in shadow. Passengers in that basket pointed at them, some concerned, some curious, a few already filming with their phones. 
Aya tried to turn away from the cameras and kept pulling the vent line hard.
Six hundred meters. Five-fifty.
The helicopter's approaching sound changed pitch, rotors echoing off the rock formations differently as they descended into the valley. Aya risked a glance up. The aircraft was checking another balloon two positions away from where they'd been, still working through its methodical search pattern.
But they were falling fast now, dropping below the main cluster of balloons, though surely drawing a lot of attention. The other pilots were maintaining cruise altitude, giving their passengers the extended tour. Aya was doing the opposite, deliberately crash-diving toward the ground.
Five hundred meters. Four-fifty. The ground was no longer an abstract beauty but a rapidly approaching reality. Details emerging from the general landscape. Individual rock formations. Sparse vegetation. The texture of the earth itself.
"Aya, shit," Amina called over the roaring wind. "That's really fast."
"I know, sorry." Aya released the vent line and nudged the burner, trying to slow their descent. The flames roared, blasting heat into the envelope, but thermal inertia meant nothing happened immediately. The balloon needed time to respond, time to heat up, time they didn't have.
“Let’s not end up splattered on a rock. I’d like to hear what you were about to say to me before they crashed our romantic date in the sky.”
Four hundred meters. Three-fifty.
Aya fired the burner again, longer this time, feeling the heat sear her face and arms. The descent rate slowed slightly, but they were still falling faster than any controlled landing should be.
Three hundred meters. The terrain below was rougher than it had looked from altitude. Rocky outcrops, scattered boulders, patches of thorny scrub. Landing sites were sparse and getting sparser as the ground rushed up.
"There," Aya said, spotting a relatively flat area between two fairy chimney formations. The ground looked unforgiving, but it was the best option in their rapidly shrinking window of choice.
She aimed for it by controlling their descent rate, firing the burner in measured blasts, trying to time it so they'd arrive over the flat area with minimal forward velocity and manageable downward speed.
Two hundred meters. One-fifty. The wind shifted, catching them from the side, pushing them toward the larger of the two rock formations. Aya fired the burner desperately, trying to add enough heat to lift them over the obstacle, but they were too low, too heavy, too committed.
One hundred meters.
"We're going to hit those rocks!" Amina shouted.
Aya yanked the vent line fully open, dumping all the hot air she dared, willing the balloon to drop now rather than drift forward into the formation. The envelope collapsed partially, losing shape, and they fell like a stone.
Seventy meters. Fifty.
The flat area was beneath them now, but they were coming in too hot, with too much forward momentum. Aya fired the burner in one final, sustained blast, five seconds of flame, trying to arrest their fall.
Thirty meters. Twenty.
"Brace!" Aya screamed, desperately clutching the basket’s rails and leaning back.
The basket hit the ground and shot pain through Aya's legs and spine, the wicker frame flexing and cracking, but miraculously holding together. Her teeth clacked together hard, and she tasted a hint of blood as she heard the shriek of wicker against stone, Amina's sharp cry of pain, and the whoosh of the balloon beginning to settle.
But then the basket left the ground again, became airborne for one impossible second, rising three meters on residual lift and momentum before gravity reclaimed them.
The second impact was worse.
They came down at an angle and bounced, the basket tilting as it hit. Aya was thrown sideways, unable to hold on against the force, her shoulder slamming into the wicker wall. Amina crashed into her, and both of them tangled as the basket tipped further, threatening to spill them out entirely.
The balloon still had some lift and was dragging them forward across the rough ground. The basket scraped over rocks, tilted further, then caught on a boulder and overcorrected, slamming back down on its base with a jolt before continuing back in the opposite direction.
Scraping. Bouncing. Tilting. The world reduced to violent motion and the desperate need to hold on, to not be thrown out over the ledge, to survive the next second, and the next.
Desperately flailing, Aya's hand found the vent line again and pulled it with her body weight. 
The envelope deflated rapidly, the last hot air rushing out through the parachute valve, the fabric crumpling, losing its remaining structure.
They skidded across the ground, basket dragging through scrub that tore at the wicker, over stones that sent them bouncing and tilting. Aya saw the large rock outcrop ahead, gray stone rising from the earth like a wall, and knew if they hit it at this speed, the basket would shatter and them with it.
But the deflating envelope was killing their momentum, creating drag. They slowed. The outcrop loomed closer. Ten meters. Five.
The basket ground to a stop with one final bone-rattling impact, the wicker frame hiding against the rock with a hollow thump that echoed down into the valley.
Then silence. Complete, ringing silence after the violence of the landing.
Aya lay tangled with Amina in the bottom of the basket, both of them breathing hard, neither moving. Dust settled around them. The envelope draped over the basket like a shroud, still radiating heat, the fabric making small ticking sounds as it cooled.
"Guess we’re not dead?" Amina asked, her voice muffled against Aya's hair and shoulder.
"I don't think so."
Aya pushed herself up on trembling arms, her body cataloging damage: ribs screaming where she'd hit the basket edge, her stitched side throbbing with renewed fury, left shoulder potentially separated from the impact, dozens of smaller pains that would reveal themselves fully once the adrenaline wore off.
But Amina didn’t follow.
"Hey," Aya said, fear cutting through the pain fog. She rolled Amina onto her back, hands running over her quickly, checking for blood, for obvious breaks, for anything that meant immediate danger. "Amina. Look at me."
Amina's eyes opened, unfocused for a moment, then found Aya's face. "Ow."
"Where? Tell me where."
"Everywhere?" Amina tried to laugh, but it came out as a wheeze. "Mostly my head. Hit something. Having a hard time focusing."
Aya's hands found Amina's head, running her fingers gently through her hair for any telltale softness of a fracture or the wet heat of bleeding. Then she found it. A lump was forming on the back left, already the size of a walnut. But no blood, no give in the bone beneath.
"Concussion," Aya said. "Can you focus on my finger?"
She held up her index finger, moved it slowly left and right. Amina's eyes tracked it smoothly, pupils equal and reactive despite the pain evident in her expression.
"Good. That's good." Aya's hands moved lower, slowly checking Amina's body for pain or instability. Amina sucked in a sharp breath when Aya's fingers found the right side of her ribcage.
"Bruised, not broken," Aya assessed, pressing gently. "Does it hurt to breathe deeply?"
Amina took a careful breath, deeper than before. "A little, but it’s not sharp. Not like in Prague."
Aya smiled at the memory, but continued her assessment, hands moving over Amina’s body with an old, practiced familiarity. Hips, legs, ankles. Everything intact. Scratches and forming bruises everywhere, but nothing that wouldn't heal.
"You're going to be okay," Aya said, some of the tension leaving her voice. "Banged up, but okay."
"Your turn." Amina sat up slowly, grimacing. "And don't lie to me about how bad it is."
She rested her hand gently against Aya's side, where the stitches were, where the wound from Istanbul had reopened during their underground escape. Aya couldn't suppress the hiss of pain.
"Still bleeding?" Amina asked.
"Don't think so. Just angry about being thrown around."
Amina lifted Aya's shirt carefully, examining the wound through its bandage. The white gauze showed a small red bloom, fresh but not actively flowing. "Stitches held. That's something."
Her hands moved to Aya's shoulder, the one that had taken the brunt of the first impact. She probed it gently, rotated Aya's arm through its range of motion.
“Fuck,” Aya said through an exhale. "Separated?"
"Don't think so. But close. You're going to have limited use of that arm for a while." Amina's fingers lingered on Aya's shoulder, her touch shifting from medical assessment to something softer, more concerned. "You're a disaster, habibi."
Aya laughed. "Says the woman who bruises easily and has a concussion. Your whole body will be black and purple by evening."
They looked at each other and started laughing. Everything hurt, but Aya couldn't stop shaking with laughter born from relief, residual adrenaline, and the sheer absurdity of stealing a hot air balloon and crash-landing it in the middle of Cappadocia.
Aya's ribs ached where she'd slammed into the basket edge, and her stitched side throbbed with renewed vigor, but nothing felt broken or torn. "We need to move. They'll spot the balloon from the air."
They climbed out of the basket on unsteady legs. The deflated balloon lay sprawled across the ground like a fallen parachute, dancing slightly in the breeze. Forty meters of red and gold fabric that might as well be a flare announcing their position.
"Behind those rocks," Amina said, pointing to a cluster of large formations thirty meters away. "If we can get it into shadow..."
They each grabbed a section of fabric and pulled. The rig was heavier than Aya expected, the material thick, and the sheer volume of it created drag as they hauled it across the rough ground. Her shoulder screamed with each pull, and she found herself drenched in sweat despite the cool air.
Halfway to the rocks, Aya stopped and glanced skyward. "Shit. We need to go faster," she panted. 
The helicopter was nearly overhead, still distant but growing louder.
They pulled harder, stumbling backward, the fabric catching on every rock and bush. 
They reached the shadow of the rock formation and shoved the envelope into a crevice between two large boulders, stuffing the fabric in desperately, Amina climbing partway up to push it deeper while Aya gathered armfuls and fed it to her. The bright colors disappeared into shadow, red and gold fading to dark shapes barely distinguishable from the stone.
The helicopter’s whir grew distinct enough to identify the direction, northeast, working its way through a search pattern that would bring it overhead within minutes.
The basket was still visible, sitting in full sun like an advertisement. They went back for it and grabbed the wicker frame, lighter than the mass of fabric but more awkward, and dragged it into the shadow, wedging it beside the fabric. Aya grabbed handfuls of scrub brush and scattered it over both, creating a hasty camouflage that wouldn't survive long but might fool a disinterested helicopter pilot scanning from altitude.
What had been a whir grew into a roar. Aya and Amina pressed themselves against the rock face as the aircraft passed directly overhead, low enough that Aya could feel the rotor wash, see the shadow slide across the ground.
It kept moving, the sound fading gradually, the search pattern continuing.
"That was lucky. We can't stay here," Amina said once the helicopter had moved on. "Too exposed. If they do a second pass and actually look at the ground..."
Aya surveyed the landscape, already exhausted, already hurting, but forcing herself to think tactically through the fog. They needed somewhere defensible, concealed, where they could rest without being spotted from the air or ground.
"That way," she said, pointing about half a kilometer away to what looked like a structure partially collapsed into the landscape. Not fairy chimneys, but human construction. An old farmhouse, maybe, or shepherd's shelter. "Stay low, use cover."
They moved in a crouch, using the curving contours of the land and the twisting rock formations to mask their movement. Every twenty meters, they stopped, listened, and scanned the sky. The helicopter made another pass, further south now, its search expanding outward.
“No other birds,” Amina said. “Hopefully, that means those bastards don’t realize that was us.”
Aya nodded. “Hopefully.”
By the time they reached the structure, Aya's legs were shaking from exhaustion, and her shoulder had gone from screaming pain to a deep, nauseating throb.
The farmhouse, if that's what it had once been, was older than she'd thought from a distance. The roof had partially collapsed decades ago, timbers had rotted, and tiles were scattered across the interior. Three walls still stood, the fourth crumbled to knee-high rubble. No doors, no windows intact, but the remaining walls provided concealment from above.
They entered cautiously, checking for snakes or other wildlife, for signs of recent habitation. 
The floor was packed earth, covered in layers of dust and debris: broken dishes, a rusted plow in the far left corner, pieces of rotted furniture that had begun their return to the soil. 
"Home sweet home," Amina said, her voice heavy with exhaustion. 
Aya turned around and joined her. In what had once been a storage area, she’d found a stockpile of hay. Old hay, musty and gray, but still dry, still providing insulation from the cold ground.
They collapsed into it without ceremony, too tired to care about comfort, too battered to worry about anything except not moving for a while. Their clothes were still damp from the cistern crossing earlier, and the landing had added new layers of dirt and sweat. Aya's hands shook with a tremor from the aftereffects of fear and exertion.
"That was insane," Amina said, a laugh escaping that sounded slightly unhinged. "We stole a hot air balloon. Flew it over Cappadocia. And crash-landed in the middle of nowhere."
"Successfully crash-landed," Aya corrected. "We're alive."
"We always make it."
They fell silent, listening to the wind outside, the creak of old wood, their own breathing gradually slowing. Amina shifted closer, seeking warmth, and Aya didn't pull away. They lay together in the hay, exhaustion claiming them piece by piece.
"What you said earlier," Aya began, then stopped, unsure how to finish.
"Forget it," Amina said quickly. "Bad timing. Bad place. I shouldn't have—"
"You weren't wrong," Aya interrupted. "About who I am. What I want." She went quiet, attempting to straighten out confusing thoughts before giving up. "I've been trying to convince myself I could be someone else. Someone who could settle down, teach students, and live a normal life. But every time things go wrong, every time we're running from something or stealing something or one bad decision away from death, I feel—"
"Alive," Amina finished softly.
"Yeah."
"So what does that mean? For us? For him?"
"I don't know," Aya admitted. "I care about Karim. I meant everything I said about wanting a future. But maybe..." She trailed off, the thought incomplete, the answer still forming.
Amina didn't push. She just lay there, close enough that Aya could feel her warmth, could see the new silver tattoos catching the light that filtered through the broken roof. The patterns were beautiful beyond aesthetics, a permanent reminder of forces beyond human understanding.
Aya reached out, tracing one of the patterns with a fingertip, following the eight-pointed star on Amina's forearm. Amina's breath hitched, but she didn't pull away.
"They're quiet now," Amina said. "The markings. No burning, no pulling. Just... there. Like they've become part of me."
"They're beautiful," Aya said. “They suit you.”
Their eyes met, and the world narrowed to the space between them.
Aya momentarily regretted her words, suddenly acutely aware of how close they were lying. Close enough to see the different shades of brown in Amina's eyes, the way gold flecks caught the light.
Amina's gaze dropped to Aya's mouth, just for a second, then back to her eyes. She smiled before lying back further, getting more comfortable by her side.
Every nerve in Aya's body was awake despite the exhaustion, attuned to Amina's proximity, to the heat radiating from her skin, to the infinitesimal movements that suggested intention.
Amina turned closer, barely an inch, but in the confined space of their bodies pressed together in the hay, it felt monumental. Her hand, which had been resting on her own side, moved. Fingers brushed Aya's hip, light as breath, then settled there with more certainty.
Aya's heart hammered. Her own hand, the one that had been tracing the silver marks on Amina's arm, stilled. She could close the gap. Should she? Every cell in her body screamed while her mind threw up a thousand reasons why this was complicated, impossible, a betrayal of Karim, who'd done nothing but support her.
"Aya," Amina whispered as she cozied up in the hay. Her voice was rough with exhaustion. Not quite a question, not quite permission. Just her name, weighted with everything they'd left unsaid for months.
Aya's breath caught. She could feel the moment crystallizing, becoming one of those pivotal choices that would define everything after. Lean forward or pull back. Act on this or let it pass. Choose the chaos of what she felt or the safety of what she'd committed to.
Aya made her decision. Started to close the distance momentarily. Hesitated. Saw Amina's pupils dilate, saw her lips part slightly—
Then Amina's eyes fluttered closed, exhaustion claiming her, pulling her under before Aya could act on the moment hanging between them, on Amina’s earlier words.
Aya froze, suspended in that almost-kiss, then slowly relaxed back, her heart pounding, hands shaking. Relief and disappointment warred in her chest in equal measure.
Maybe it was better this way, Aya thought. Maybe the universe was giving them both an out, a pause button on a decision neither was ready to make with a clear head.
Aya lay awake, watching light move across the broken ceiling, listening to Amina's breathing deepen. She thought about the balloon ride, about the sheer beauty of sunrise over Cappadocia, about the terror of the landing. She thought about Amina's words on every topic, about her own response, about the truth buried in both.
Once Aegis was stopped, what did she actually want? She still didn't have an answer.
Chapter 29
Twenty kilometers east, Karim half-dragged, half-carried Hamza through a passage so narrow their shoulders scraped both walls. The older man's weight pressed against his side, one arm slung over Karim's shoulders, each step punctuated by gasps of pain.
"When stone rings like a bell," Hamza managed between breaths, "you're beneath temple ruins." He lifted his free hand and rapped his knuckles against the wall. The sound returned pure and resonant, like striking crystal. "Byzantine monastery overhead. Collapsed five hundred years ago, but the foundations remain."
They reached a junction where the passage split three ways. Karim stopped, letting Hamza rest against the wall while he examined each opening with his phone's dim light.
"Right," Hamza said, reading his hesitation. "Always take the ascending path when pursued underground."
"Even with your ankle?"
Hamza looked down at his injured foot, the joint swollen to twice its normal size, the improvised splint already working loose. "Especially with my ankle. I slow you down on flat ground. Going up, we can use handholds."
The climb was brutal. The passage was more ladder than corridor, with handholds and footholds carved at regular intervals. Hamza pulled himself up with his arms while Karim climbed below, one hand always braced against the older man's back, ready to catch him if he slipped.
Ten meters up, Hamza's grip faltered. He swung sideways with a choked cry. Karim lunged, wedging his shoulder under Hamza's weight, pinning him against the wall until he could find a new purchase.
They hung there, breathing hard.
"I'm a liability," Hamza said quietly. "You should leave me. I'll find my way out."
"Absolutely not." The words came harder than Karim intended. "We move together or not at all."
"Aya would want you to complete the mission. To protect what you found."
"I don't abandon people." Karim adjusted his position, taking more weight. "Besides, you know these caves. I don't. I need you."
The stabilization wafer in his pocket seemed to burn against his hip with a reminder that he'd already made one selfish choice today. He wouldn't make another.
"If I fall, you let me go," Hamza said. "Promise me."
"I promise to catch you. That's the only promise I'm making. Now move."
They climbed. Behind them, voices echoed from below, growing closer.
"They're faster than us," Hamza whispered.
"Then we need to be smarter."
At the top, the passage widened into a chamber where three routes branched off. They collapsed against the wall, gasping. Below, flashlight beams swept the junction, powerful tactical lights making Karim's phone look pathetic.
"They'll check all three," Karim said. "We can't outrun them."
"No." Hamza's eyes swept the chamber. "But we can outlast them. They're outsiders. They don't know these passages like my blood knows them."
He pointed to a section of the wall. "There. Press the fourth stone from the floor. The one shaped like a tooth."
Karim found it, pressed hard. The stone shifted with a grating sound, and a section of wall swung inward, revealing a narrow crawlspace.
"In. Quickly."
They squeezed through. Karim pulled the door closed, and total darkness engulfed them.
He reached for his phone, but Hamza's hand stopped him. "No light. They might see it through cracks."
They sat in darkness so complete that Karim couldn't see his own hand. Their shoulders touched. Their breathing sounded impossibly loud.
Footsteps entered the chamber outside. Multiple sets. The scrape of equipment.
"Three passages. Alpha team takes the descent. Bravo, check the left branch. We'll take the climbing route."
"They went up. Blood over here. One of them is injured."
Karim's heart hammered.
Two sets of boots headed for the climbing route. Then a pause.
"Hold on. Dust pattern here is wrong."
Karim felt a chill run down his spine. He hadn’t entertained the idea of entering a fight without Aya or Amina.
"What do you mean?"
"Climbing route shows recent disturbance. But there's dust settled around this wall section that shouldn't be there."
Silence.
Then: "I don’t see anything, but there could be a hidden passage. These caves are full of them."
"Mark it for follow-up. Right now, at least one of them is just ahead of us and injured. We can come back after we have them in custody."
"Understood. Moving up."
The boots ascended. The sounds faded. Karim and Hamza sat frozen, neither daring to move.
Minutes passed. Five. Ten. Karim counted his heartbeats, forced his breathing to slow.
Finally, Hamza whispered, "They've moved on. But they'll come back. We need to use the time we have."
Karim pulled out his phone, brightness at minimum. The passage ahead was a crawlspace, barely a meter high. They'd have to move on hands and knees. "Where does this lead?" he asked.
"To the shepherd's network. The old routes my grandfather had me walk when I was a boy." Hamza’s voice carried something between nostalgia and grief. "I hated those games, but he was teaching me to survive."
"Can you do this?" Karim asked.
"I have to. We both do."
They crawled. The passage was claustrophobic, walls and ceiling pressing close. Hamza pulled himself forward with his arms, dragging his injured leg. Every few meters, he'd stop, breathing hard through gritted teeth, then force himself onward.
Karim followed, mind bouncing between fear and guilt. He'd taken and hidden the lens component, thinking he was preserving something, protecting Çelebi's legacy. But watching Hamza drag himself through agony after the man had shared everything, trusted them completely, the brass piece felt less like salvation and more like betrayal.
"Hamza," Karim said, the words escaping before he could stop them. "I need to tell you something."
"Save your breath. Talking wastes energy."
"This isn’t a waste. Look, I took something. From the workshop. A small wafer with engravings, but it’s curious. I may be losing it, but it seems like it’s some kind of alien metal. I can’t imagine what it could be. Every other component has been made of typical elements, but not this one. I can’t wait to study it."
Hamza stopped crawling. The silence stretched.
"I hid it from everyone, and I’m not sure why I did it," Karim continued. "I guess I thought if we had to destroy the lens, at least one piece could survive for study. But really. I think I just... I wanted to keep something. For my research. Because at the end of the day, I’m not cut out for this, I’m meant to be a historian."
More silence. Then: "Show me."
Karim pulled out the thin, intricate component and shone his phone on it. Hamza took it in dirty, shaking hands, examining the engravings, the precise hole through its center.
"Do you know what this is?" Hamza asked finally.
"Part of a stabilization array. Çelebi's notes said that without it, the lens can't maintain coherence."
"So without this piece, the lens cannot work safely."
"Yes."
Hamza was quiet for a long moment, turning the wafer over. "My family protected these secrets for fifteen generations. Not because we understood them, but because we believed they were important. We were part of the legacy. We believed someone would come who could use them wisely." He looked at Karim. "Was I wrong to trust you?"
The question hit like a physical blow. "I don't know," Karim admitted. "I wanted to be worthy of that trust. I thought I was. But then in the workshop, surrounded by all that knowledge, all that history... I couldn't let it all disappear."
"This is not the way."
Karim's throat tightened.
"Let me tell you a story,” Hamza continued. “It’s about Aya's father, Hassan. I didn’t tell Aya this full story yet, but his work saved my grandfather's life in a way." Hamza's eyes grew distant. "Nineteen years ago, Hassan came to Cappadocia. He'd found references to the Astral Lens in Ottoman archives, was tracking its components with another researcher here in Turkey. My grandfather was still alive then, still the keeper for the Silent Meridian. Hassan spent three months here, studying what we had, decoding Çelebi's notes.
"Our family has always kept channels open to others who guard similar secrets. Then, when Hassan died in Colombia, word reached us within days through the old networks."
"What happened?"
"He assembled a partial system in our workshop. He never ventured deep underground, and never got nearly as far as you all have. He had just three components, enough to test the principles at the time." Hamza's voice dropped. "When he activated it during a minor planetary alignment... the energy discharge was catastrophic. Not large-scale, thank God. He'd had the sense to do it in an isolated chamber. But the heat, the light, the wrongness of what came through those dimensional fractures..."
Karim felt cold spread through his chest. "What did he see?"
"He wouldn't speak of it. Not in detail. But afterward, he spent two days dismantling everything, scattering components, destroying or encrypting his research. My grandfather asked why, because if the system worked, even partially, wasn't that proof it should be studied further?" Hamza shook his head. "He said some knowledge was too dangerous. That what he'd glimpsed on the other side of those fractures... it was aware. Intelligent. Waiting."
"And then?"
"He left. Went to Cambodia to investigate similar phenomena, but we did not hear from him for a long time. Then, we got word that he died in Colombia in 2019. Equipment failure during a climb, if I remember correctly." Hamza's expression darkened. "But my grandfather never believed it. Said Hassan was too careful, too experienced. And there were rumors of another researcher with him, a Turkish academic named Malik, who my grandfather distrusted."
The name landed like a stone. "Osman Malik, or Malik Osman?"
"You know him?"
"He's the one hunting us now. Leading Aegis, orchestrating all of this."
Hamza's eyes widened. "I don’t know the whole story, but I believe they’d been partners when Hassan was here working on his Astral Lens research, but they’d disagreed strongly about what to do with their discoveries and parted ways after Hassan destroyed his work. Then, Malik reappears with Hassan in Colombia when he died."
"You think Malik killed him?"
"Or failed to prevent his death when he could have. Either way, Hassan's death served Malik's purposes and removed the one man who understood the system well enough to oppose him, leaving the research scattered and vulnerable." Hamza gripped Karim's shoulder. "But your friend Aya, she's walking in her father's footsteps. Fighting the same battle he fought. And Malik... he will carry a grudge, no matter what he says. He will believe Hassan betrayed him, chose fear over progress. This will be personal for him."
Karim's mind raced, pieces clicking together. The intensity of Malik's pursuit. The resources committed. This wasn't just about the lens—it was about finishing what Hassan had tried to destroy. About proving Hassan wrong.
"Aya doesn't know, but she may suspect something," Karim said quietly. "She knows her father died in Colombia, and that he used to work with Malik, but not about his direct involvement there."
"Then you need to tell her. Before you reach Bodrum, before you face whatever comes next."
Hamza handed the component back. "This is not your choice to make alone. If the lens must be destroyed, then all of it must be destroyed. If it can be used wisely, then all of it must be available. You understand?"
Karim closed his fingers around the wafer, feeling its weight differently."Yes."
"Will you give it back to Aya? Let her decide its fate with the rest?"
Every instinct screamed against it. This piece of Çelebi's genius, potentially the last surviving fragment, was consigned to possible destruction. But Hamza was right. This wasn't his choice to make.
"Yes," Karim said quietly. "You’re right, I'll give it back."
"Good. Then my role is nearly complete." Hamza was quiet for a moment, his breathing labored in the narrow space. "But there is one more thing."
"What?"
"The woman. Leyla." Hamza's voice dropped even lower. "Something about her doesn't settle right with me."
Karim frowned. "She's been invaluable. Her intelligence background, her contacts—"
"Yes. Exactly." Hamza's hand found Karim's arm in the darkness, gripping with surprising strength. "In my experience, when someone appears exactly when you need them and has exactly what you need..." He trailed off. “She is not as I remember her from our previous meetings.”
"You think she's working for someone else? Aegis? That’s impossible, I’ve watched her gun down some of their operatives."
"All I think is, I've watched her these past days. The way she documents everything. The way her eyes track Aya like she's memorizing escape routes." Hamza's grip tightened. "I may be wrong. I hope I am. But if I'm right, she's positioning herself for something, and you won't see it coming until it's too late."
Karim thought about Leyla going west alone, carrying the assembly charts. About how she'd been the one to suggest splitting up.
"What should I do?"
"Watch her, because something’s different, but don't confront her. That would tip your hand. But watch and be ready to move when the moment comes, if it is necessary. I’m an old man, I’m not always right." Hamza released his arm. "Now. We survive."
They crawled for what felt like hours. The passage gradually widened until they could crouch, then finally stand. Eventually, a faint daylight appeared ahead, but after the absolute dark, it looked like salvation to Karim.
They emerged into a shepherd's cave overlooking Avanos. The town spread below, houses catching the rising sun. The air was cold and clean.
Hamza collapsed, his ankle finally refusing all weight. Karim examined the joint. It was grotesquely swollen, skin tight and shiny, darkening with bruises that looked black in the dawn light.
"We need to get you to a hospital," Karim said.
"Later. First, we need to make sure you reach Bodrum safely." He gestured weakly at the components in Karim's pack. "That this reaches its destination."
Karim sat beside Hamza, both watching the sun paint the valley gold and rose.
"Aya's father would be proud of what you’re all doing," Hamza said suddenly.
Karim shook his head. "I don't know about that."
"I do. Not of your deception, that was foolish. But you admit your mistake and are willing to make it right." Hamza's hand found Karim's shoulder, gripped with surprising strength. "Hassan died protecting knowledge from the wrong hands. You're honoring that legacy by choosing to trust the right person with it. You may not be cut out for this life, as you said, but you’re doing what you must, when you must. Your old life is always waiting for you."
Chapter 30
Twenty kilometers west, Leyla emerged from darkness into dawn.
The drainage grate fought her, its rusted hinges screaming as she pushed upward, her muscles burning from hours of navigating the Roman aqueduct system. When her head broke the surface, the smell hit first. Not just sewage, though that was there, but diesel fumes, hot asphalt, the metallic tang of Nevşehir's industrial district waking for another day.
She pulled herself through the opening, knees scraping concrete, hands finding purchase on ground that felt impossibly solid after the slick, ancient stonework below. For a moment, she knelt there on the sidewalk, breathing air that wasn't filtered through two thousand years of mineral deposits.
A truck rumbled past, its driver doing a double-take in his mirror, watching a woman climbing from a drainage system, covered in filth. Leyla watched his brake lights flare. Then, after a three-second calculation, they released, and the truck continued.
Two more workers passed during her walk to the equipment cache, one averting his eyes entirely and the other staring but not stopping. Leyla cataloged their faces anyway, filed them under potential complications. But they kept walking, and she reached the abandoned building without incident.
The cache was where she'd left it six months ago, during the operational prep phase when she'd still believed this assignment had a clean endpoint, when she and Emre had worked side-by-side.
She pulled the weatherproof bag from behind loose bricks and laid out its contents. Clean clothes. Laptop. Fresh identity papers. First aid kit. Cash. A backup phone, the one her team didn't know existed, wrapped in a Faraday bag.
And a small photograph printed on thin printer paper, worn at the edges from too much handling.
Emre laughed, shirtless, his hand reaching toward her as she took the photo. Taken eight months ago in Derinkuyu, the day before they'd separated for what was supposed to be two weeks. The day before he'd vanished into Aegis's machinery.
Leyla pressed her thumb against his face, smearing the photo with underground grime she hadn't noticed on her hands. She tried to clean it, but only made it worse.
It had been three months since she'd heard his voice, held his hand, woken up next to him in their flat overlooking the Bosphorus. And all that time, following orders from people who held his life as collateral for her cooperation.
She set the photo carefully atop the cache contents and began stripping.
The tactical gear came off in layers. Each piece removed felt like peeling away an identity. Leyla the ally, Leyla the field operative, Leyla who'd fought beside Aya and Amina and Karim with genuine camaraderie that made what came next so much worse.
She stood naked in the abandoned building's cool air, feeling suddenly exposed with goosebumps rising, and looked down at herself. Bruises from the underground escape. Scrapes from rough stone. Dirt ground so deeply into her skin that the first wipe with a cloth barely made a difference.
She found a bottle of water in the cache and poured it over her hands first, watching dirt run in dark rivulets down her wrists. The water was cold, shocking, tightening against her skin. She used a clean t-shirt as a cloth, starting at her fingertips and working up each arm, revealing skin beneath the grime.
She poured more water, let it cascade down her torso, and she closed her eyes against the sensation. Cold drops slid down her chest, pooling in her navel, running down the plane of her stomach. Her skin came clean in patches, revealing the contrast between filth and flesh. She wiped the cloth slowly, washing away the evidence of the woman she'd become. The water was nearly gone when she finally felt clean.
This is what betrayal looks like, she thought. This is the cost.
Partially refreshed, Leyla extracted her clean clothes and quickly dressed, transforming. Dark jeans, a silk blouse in cream, and a light jacket cut to conceal the handgun holstered at her hip. She released her hair from its ponytail, shook it out, then ran her fingers through to work out the worst tangles. She found her makeup kit and applied just enough foundation to cover the shadows, along with some subtle eye work to look alert.
When Leyla looked in the compact mirror, her invented persona of Elif Yılmaz looked back. Sales representative, textile company, Ankara. Normal woman on a normal business trip making normal money doing normal work.
She packed the tactical gear into a trash bag, walked three blocks, and dropped it in a dumpster behind a restaurant. Evidence destroyed. Identity erased.
Twenty minutes after emerging from the drainage system, she walked into a roadside café to grab breakfast before hitting the highway.
The interior of the small establishment was trying too hard. Plastic plants, laminated menus, and photographs of Istanbul tourist sites that had nothing to do with Nevşehir. Turkish pop music played too loudly from speakers mounted in corners. The coffee smelled burnt.
Leyla ordered tea at the counter and found a table in the back where she could watch both the entrance and the kitchen exit, then pulled out her phone.
Her hands trembled as she unwrapped it from the Faraday bag.
This phone had no contacts saved, no message history, nothing that could compromise her if discovered. Just a single number she knew by heart, burned into memory the day they'd given it to her along with the photograph and the promise: you will be contacted by your colleague Omar soon, and he will tell you about a plan to collect and safeguard the Astral Lens, along with Aya Amrani and her associates. Cooperate with them fully, support them, and report everything to us. When this is over, your boyfriend lives.
She stood sharply to make the call outside. She couldn't bear to do it while sitting, while comfortable, while pretending this was just another operational check-in. The café's rear courtyard was deserted except for three plastic tables, dying plants in concrete planters, and a morning sun just beginning to paint the high walls with light. Leyla stood with her back against the sun-warmed brick and dialed from memory.
The line clicked to a voice she knew too well.
"Leyla." Malik's tone carried excitement, barely contained, thrumming beneath his usual measured control. "I received your transmission. The photographs are... remarkable."
"The workshop held more than we expected," she said carefully. "The calibration rings alone—"
"I saw." She could hear him moving, pacing, the sound of his footsteps echoing in whatever space he occupied. "Çelebi's genius, preserved for four centuries. And now, finally, within reach." A pause, then quieter: "Hassan would have been devastated. All his work to scatter these pieces in old Silent Meridian sites, and his own daughter brings them together."
Leyla said nothing. She'd learned not to engage when Malik mentioned Hassan.
"The Bodrum site is confirmed, then?" he continued.
"Yes. The tidal calculations from the charts point there. They'll move within twenty-four hours, once everyone regroups."
"Good. Good." More pacing. "Do you understand what waits for them there?"
"The coastal workshop. More components, presumably."
"Not just components." Malik's voice dropped, taking on the reverent tone he used when discussing the lens's potential. "Based on your photos, the crown lens, Leyla. The control mechanism. The piece that allows the system to be safely operated, powered down, or to sustain the connection indefinitely."
"I thought the crown lens was lost."
"No, these diagrams point to a specific chamber that can only be accessed at certain tidal conditions. A chamber that..." He paused, and she could hear the smile in his voice. "A chamber that may require Hassan's bloodline to open, after his failed experiments in Colombia. "
"His bloodline?"
"The Silent Meridian's security measures are elegant. Çelebi designed his most dangerous cache to respond only to those already touched by the lens's energy. Once initiated, you could initiate others, and so on. The way of the secret society. But I believe Hassan's activation attempt nineteen years ago, even though he destroyed the failed assembly afterward, left a mark. A resonance. That resonance may have passed to his daughter. The… situation with Ms. Said’s djinn contact in Morocco confirms my suspicions when dealing with these energy artifacts and their failsafes."
Leyla suppressed her anger and replied evenly. "So Aya is the key."
"She's always been the key. Why do you think I've allowed her to live this long? To gather the components I couldn't reach? To solve puzzles that required her father's research?" Malik laughed, a sound that grew unhinged beneath the surface, in a way it hadn’t months ago. "She's been doing my work for me, Leyla. And she doesn't even know it."
"What happens in Bodrum?"
"My dive team is already in position. They'll tail the boat, wait underwater while Aya retrieves the crown lens, in case she's the only one who can. Once it's extracted, once she surfaces with it in her hands..." Another pause. "She stops being useful."
The words crackled through the line. "You're going to kill her."
"I'm going to complete what Hassan was too afraid to finish. The alignment is in three days, Leyla. Three days until Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn form the configuration Çelebi documented. Three days until the lens can channel energy from sources Hassan only glimpsed before he ran away." Malik's voice hardened. "I won't make his mistake. I won't let fear steal humanity's greatest opportunity for evolution. Anyone in the way stands in opposition to humanity’s progress."
Leyla gripped the phone so tightly her knuckles ached. She'd known this moment would come, known from the beginning that Aegis's endgame wasn't preservation but use, but hearing it stated so plainly, so casually, felt painful. Aya's death was discussed like a line item on a project plan.
"And the others?" she asked. "Amina? Karim?"
"Collateral. We can use them as leverage if needed, dispose of them if not. They're not essential to the mechanism." A pause. "Though Amina might be interesting to study afterward. The djinn energy that was extracted in the workshop, the residual connection... There may be applications."
Leyla closed her eyes. Amina, who'd screamed as ancient power was ripped from her body. Who'd risked her life to help them. Who might now become a lab specimen if Malik had his way.
"What do you need from me?" Leyla asked, forcing her voice steady.
"Stay with them until Bodrum. Guide them to the coastal site, help them locate the crown lens." Malik's voice sharpened with focus. "My dive team will be positioned underwater, waiting. They'll tail you during the descent. When Aya retrieves the crown lens, assuming the chamber requires her bloodline, as I suspect, my team will move as soon as they begin to surface."
"An ambush. At the dive site."
"A retrieval operation," Malik corrected. "Clean, efficient, final. They surface with the crown lens. We deal with them underwater, board, and take all the components. The fragments, rings, cylinder, focusing heart, and the crown lens itself. Everything in one coordinated action."
Leyla's throat tightened. "And Aya's team?"
"Aya dies the moment she hands over the crown lens. It's unfortunate, I genuinely admired her father, but she's served her purpose and proves too dangerous to be left alive." His tone became clinical. "Karim has archaeological knowledge that might prove useful during assembly and calibration. If he fights, he dies with her, but if he can be subdued, I can find a place for him here."
"And Amina?"
A pause. "The residual djinn connection is... Intriguing. After what we observed in the workshop, the way dimensional energy responds to her, even with the marks burned out... Yes. Amina should be captured alive if possible. Tranquilize her during the ambush. We'll need to study how the purification affected her, whether the connection can be reestablished or amplified."
Leyla felt nauseous. "You want to experiment on her."
"I want to understand what makes her function as a conduit. That understanding could be the difference between controlled activation and catastrophic failure." He paused. "But Leyla, if capturing her alive endangers the operation or the components, she dies. The lens is the priority. Everything else is secondary."
"What's my role during the ambush?"
"When my people surface and initiate, you help secure the components. Prevent escape from Aya, Amina, or Karim. Deal with the ship’s captain if necessary. Terminate any resistance aboard the boat." His voice softened slightly. "You've come this far. Three more days. One final action. Then you and Emre disappear together, somewhere warm, somewhere far from all of this."
Leyla closed her eyes. She'd just agreed to participate in an underwater execution. To help murder people who trusted her, fought beside her, and saved her life.
All for Emre. All to get him back. She steeled herself to eliminate one more obstacle.
"Okay, but there's a complication," Leyla said. "The old man. Hamza."
"What about him?"
"He's suspicious. I saw him watching me after we surfaced, when I was sending the photographs. The way he looked at me..." She swallowed. "He knows something's wrong. He may have warned the others."
Silence on the line. When Malik spoke again, his voice had gone flat, businesslike. "Where is he now?"
"With Karim, taking the eastern route. They should reach the rendezvous point by evening."
"He's old. Injured, according to the surveillance reports. Accidents happen in these mountains." A pause. "I'll dispatch a team. Clean, quiet, nothing that raises questions. Karim can survive until the dive if he doesn't interfere. After all, he’s proven himself very useful in solving these archaeological puzzles."
Leyla felt nauseous. She'd just ordered a man's death, a man who'd shared his family's secrets, who'd trusted them with knowledge kept hidden for generations.
"Leyla." Malik's voice softened, and somehow that was worse. "I know this is difficult. But we're so close now. Three days. You've played your role perfectly, better than I could have hoped. And when it's over, when the alignment passes, and the lens fulfills its purpose..."
"Emre," she said. "You promised."
"And I keep my promises. He's safe. Healthy. Waiting for you." A pause. "Do you want proof? I can have someone bring him to a video call within the hour."
Despite what she'd just agreed to, hope flared in Leyla’s chest. "Yes. Please."
"Done. Check your secure channel in sixty minutes." Malik's voice warmed with something that might have been affection, or might have been a very good imitation. "You've done well, Leyla. Hold course for three more days. Then you and Emre disappear together, somewhere warm, somewhere far from all of this. You'll have earned it."
The line went dead.
Leyla stood frozen in the courtyard, phone still pressed to her ear, listening to the silence where Malik's voice had been.
She'd just signed Hamza's death warrant. Agreed to participate in Aya's murder. Set in motion events that would give a madman access to power beyond comprehension.
And she'd done it for Emre. For the chance to hold him again, to see him smile, to build the life they'd planned before Aegis took everything. Could that justify what she was becoming?
She lowered the phone slowly, stared at it like something venomous. Powered it down. Wrapped it carefully.
When she walked back inside, Leyla Yılmaz's pleasant expression was firmly in place. But behind the mask, Leyla was counting. Sixty minutes until she'd see Emre's face. Three days until the alignment. Three days until she found out if anything she'd done was worth it.



Night settled over Cappadocia fully, the temperature dropping in the dramatic desert shift. In the abandoned farmhouse, Amina slept deeply. Aya lay awake beside her, watching the diffused starlight paint gold patterns across Amina's skin.
Her phone vibrated with incoming messages on their secured channel.
Two shepherds found the lost lamb. Coming home slow but whole.
Karim and Hamza were safe, moving carefully, both alive. "Slow" suggested injury, but nothing critical.
One owl watching from the west tower. Dusk brings me home.
Leyla had made it through the western route, was en route, had spotted surveillance, but evaded it.
Aya typed her reply. Two birds singing above the valley. Nest when shadows grow long.
She and Amina were safe. They'd reach the rendezvous before sunrise, Hamza's clifftop refuge, the final fallback point before continuing.
Aya should have been able to sleep; her body demanded it. Every muscle ached, her injured side throbbed with each breath, and her shoulder sent sharp complaints with any movement. Exhaustion had settled so deeply into her bones that even lying still hurt. But sleep wouldn't come.
She lay on her back in the hay, listening to Amina's deep, even breathing beside her. The other woman had fallen asleep almost instantly, her body finally claiming the rest it desperately needed. But Aya's mind wouldn't quiet, circling the same questions on an endless loop.
After ten minutes of further stillness, she gave up.
Moving carefully to avoid waking Amina, she extracted herself from the hay and stood, testing her injuries. The stitches in her side pulled but held. Her shoulder was still usable if she avoided raising her arm above horizontal. Everything else was just pain, familiar and manageable.
Her pack sat where she'd left it, and she found herself kneeling beside it, checking the components by touch. The glass fragment, wrapped in cloth, was still faintly warm. The calibration ring, its metal cool, was impossibly light. She held them both, feeling their weight, physical and otherwise.
Tomorrow they'd have all the pieces. Karim with the cylinder and his ring. Leyla with the charts. Amina with the crystal heart. And her with these, plus whatever they had yet to discover in the sea.
Everything they needed to assemble the Astral Lens. To recreate what Hassan had seen nineteen years ago and been so terrified by that he'd spent the rest of his life trying to keep it scattered. But what would they do when the time came?
She thought about her father, about the man she'd barely known. He'd died when she was nineteen, young enough that she'd still believed the world was simpler than it was, that people were categorically good or bad, that choices had clear answers.
He'd seen something. Experienced something. Probably not dissimilar to what they’d encountered in the depths below Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. He’d been touched by whatever existed on the other side of dimensional fractures, and that touch had changed him. Made him understand that humanity's reach sometimes exceeded its grasp by such a margin that reaching at all was dangerous.
And Malik had been there. Had seen the same thing. Had drawn the opposite conclusion.
Aya wondered if they'd argued about it. If there'd been a moment where their friendship fractured, where one man's caution met another man's ambition and neither could give ground. If Colombia had been an attempt at reconciliation, or if something darker had happened in those mountains.
She suspected she'd never know for certain. But the pattern was clear enough.
With a sigh, Aya turned her attention back to Amina. She'd given up her connection to the djinn energy to open the workshop. Had endured pain that Aya could barely imagine to give them access to components that might doom them all.
And during the balloon ride, before the helicopter interrupted, Amina had called her out to embrace the life she actually lived instead of the one she thought she should want.
Aya had felt the truth of it in her body.
She thought about Karim, and guilt twisted in her stomach. He deserved better than this, better than someone who couldn't give him certainty, who couldn't promise the stable future he wanted. Who almost kissed her ex-lover in a farmhouse while he was underground alone, trusting her, carrying components he'd probably die to protect.
She thought about Amina and felt something entirely different. Recognition. Understanding. The magnetic pull of someone who saw you completely and didn't ask you to be different.
But there wasn't space for that right now. Couldn't be. Not with everything waiting in Bodrum, not with Malik hunting them, not with decisions about the lens looming that would define whether she became her father's daughter or something else entirely.
Chapter 31
The sun hung low over Cappadocia, painting the fairy chimneys in shades of amber and rust as Aya and Amina climbed toward Hamza's refuge. They'd walked most of the day, keeping to backroads and dirt paths, avoiding main routes where Aegis would have checkpoints. Aya's legs burned from the constant elevation changes.
Beside her, Amina moved with visible exhaustion, the concussion from yesterday's crash landing manifesting in occasional moments where she'd pause, press her palm to her forehead, and wait for her vision to clear.
"There," Aya said, pointing up the slope where a figure stood silhouetted against the deepening sky, and extending an arm around Amina’s shoulders. “We made it.”
Mehmet stood outside, waving them forward. Once inside, the temperature dropped ten degrees in three steps. Karim rose from where he'd been sitting, his shoulders dropping when he saw them. He crossed the space and embraced Aya, arms wrapping around her with careful attention to her injuries.
But there was something different. A self-consciousness that hadn't existed before. Both of them were aware of Amina standing in the entrance, watching casually. When they separated, Karim's hand lingered on her arm. "You made it."
"We did." Aya looked past him. "Where's Hamza?"
"Here," a voice called from deeper in the cave. Hamza emerged, leaning heavily on a carved walking stick, his left ankle wrapped in fresh compression bandages. Mehmet's sister followed close behind. "Takes more than a twisted ankle to keep an old storyteller down."
Aya crossed to him, steadying him as he limped to the stone table. "You should be resting."
"I'll rest when I'm dead," Hamza said with a slight smile. "Right now, I want to hear how we're going to stop Malik."
The sound of an engine climbing the access road drew everyone's attention. Mehmet's hand dropped to where he carried a weapon, then relaxed. "Leyla."
The rental car that appeared was a late-model SUV that looked better suited to the city than their mountain path. Leyla emerged looking equally out of place. Her hair was freshly washed, makeup subtle but present, dressed in plainclothes. She moved with energy that spoke of actual rest.
"Looks like you found a hotel?" Aya asked as Leyla entered.
"I don’t deny I had the easiest exit route." Leyla gestured to the canvas bags she'd brought. "Also brought coffee and food. Figured you'd be hungry."
They gathered around the stone table. The coffee was thick, gritty, and sweet, and for several minutes no one spoke; they just ate.
Finally, Leyla pulled out an iPad. "We need to discuss our current situation."
She opened a map showing the region with red markers dotted along major roads. "I spoke with Salah and began making plans. New checkpoints went up this morning across Cappadocia. Government forces, responding to Aegis pressure. They're looking for four individuals traveling together, armed, also now wanted for the balloon incident."
She swiped to an Instagram feed that had footage from inside another balloon. The video showed Aya and Amina’s stolen balloon plummeting rapidly through the cluster of morning flights, clearly out of control. Another clip captured the crash landing from a distance. The violent impact, the basket bouncing, the envelope deflating in dramatic billows.
"Armed and dangerous. The operators filed theft and armed robbery reports with aviation authorities," Leyla continued.
"Which it was," Karim said quietly.
"It got us out," Amina countered. "We were surrounded. It was the right tactical decision."
"Those people were innocent,” Karim said.
"And we're trying to prevent a much larger catastrophe," Aya said, hearing the edge in her voice. "Sometimes that requires difficult choices."
The tension hung in the air like smoke.
Leyla cleared her throat. "Regardless, it complicates movement. Every hotel, restaurant, and tour operator has your descriptions. We have to avoid populated areas where possible."
"What's the timeline for Bodrum?" Aya asked.
"Tight." Leyla pulled up tidal charts. "As we know, the underwater chamber is tide-dependent. Access is only possible during slack tide, that brief window when the current essentially stops. Next optimal window opens in thirty-six hours. Twenty to twenty-five minutes of accessible conditions. After that, currents likely become too dangerous for three more days."
"Thirty-six hours," Aya repeated.
"It gets tighter," Leyla said and shook her head. "Aegis communications. They identified Bodrum as a high-probability location this morning. They're moving assets there now. Ground teams, surveillance, and marine resources. It’s going to be the same shit-show we had here, at the mosque, you name it. We’re still running parallel."
"There's more you need to know," Leyla said quietly. She pulled up surveillance photos of workers moving equipment at Galata Tower in Istanbul. "Aegis has been busy. Based on the pace of their preparations and cross-referencing with Salah's astronomical data, the major planetary alignment happens in approximately two days. That's when Malik will attempt activation."
The number hung in the air like a countdown timer.
She swiped through additional thermal scans and surveillance footage of heavily guarded equipment transfers. "And he's not starting from scratch. These scans suggest he already has at least three major components secured at the tower. They have to be ones we don’t know about, or reproductions. If they’re reproductions, that could suggest he has even more. We can't identify them precisely through the shielding, but the energy signatures match what we've been carrying."
Leyla pulled up her own inventory on the tablet. "Let's take stock of what we have versus what's still missing. We have the glass fragment, the primary lens element. The brass cylinder for energy channeling. Both calibration rings from the Cappadocia platform. The focusing array and crystal heart from the star chamber. We have the assembly charts from the cemetery plans."
She gestured to the map of Bodrum's coastline. "And we're going for the crown lens, the termination mechanism your father emphasized. That's seven of eight components. The only one we haven't located is the stabilization wafer, and honestly, it might not exist outside of Çelebi's theoretical notes."
Karim didn’t react. He let the sentence pass, and the weight in his pocket felt heavier.
"Which makes the crown lens absolutely critical," he said finally. "Without the wafer for fine-tuning, the crown lens becomes the only way to control or terminate an activation sequence."
"Which makes it the key," Aya said.
Karim spoke quickly. "More than that, without the crown lens, any activation attempt becomes inherently unstable. The system might function briefly, but catastrophically. The crown lens is what makes controlled operation possible, allegedly, according to Çelebi’s notes."
"So even if we prevent Malik from getting it," Aya said, "if he attempts activation with his partial system—"
"The results could be worse than if he'd succeeded," Karim finished. "Uncontrolled dimensional fractures, but potentially on a much larger scale."
“And finally,” Leyla continued. “I have support ready in Istanbul. A certain rogue carpet salesman you all know and love is already setting up safe houses and extraction routes. Omar’s on the ground.”
The effect was immediate.
Amina laughed. “Oh, thank God. If anyone can sweet-talk half the city into helping us, it’s him.”
Karim grinned. “We have been missing his special blend of chaos.”
Aya shook her head in disbelief. “So he slipped past Aegis?”
Leyla nodded. “It appears his former associates have too much on their plate now to keep too close of tabs on him. He said, and I quote, ‘Tell my favorite troublemakers to bring some souvenirs back from the beach.’”
That earned small smiles around the table, thin and tired, but real. Just the idea of Omar waiting with his bad jokes and a celebratory bottle of wine gave them something solid again.
Still smiling, Aya pulled out her phone and checked the secure channel. A message from Salah: Leyla will fill you in, but tower confirmed. Three-day window holding. They're moving like men who believe they'll succeed, but you have the upper hand. Be careful, habibti.
She sent a quick message of appreciation and stood. "We need a specific plan," Aya said. "Accounting for the fact that Aegis is already in Bodrum and Istanbul."
An hour of intense coordination followed as Leyla conveyed as much as possible about the dive site. Depth, currents, access points, timing windows.
"Guessing it’s at least twenty meters down," she said, pointing to nautical charts.
"Current?" Karim asked.
"Significant outside the slack tide window. Strong enough to be dangerous in confined spaces."
She outlined equipment needs: high-capacity tanks, backup regulators, reef hooks, and underwater lights.
"Who dives?" Karim asked.
Amina looked at Aya's side, where the bandage showed through her shirt. "That wound is barely sealed. At depth, with pressure changes, physical exertion." She shook her head. "Too risky. Water pressure alone could compromise the sutures."
"I can—," Aya started.
"I'll go," Amina said before Aya could finish. "I've logged more dives than anyone here. Done the Blue Hole in Dahab more times than I can count. I can handle current, low vis, confined spaces—"
"No," Leyla interrupted. "You can't."
Amina's expression shifted to frustration as she followed Leyla's gaze. "The concussion."
"You were unconscious yesterday," Leyla said flatly. "You've been pressing your palm to your forehead every twenty minutes since you got here. Pressure changes at depth with a recent head injury? You'd risk blackout underwater, nitrogen narcosis at shallower depths than normal, and spatial disorientation. Any of those things kills you and whoever's diving with you. It has to be Aya."
"It's minor," Amina protested. "I can—"
"You can stay on the surface and coordinate," Karim said gently. "Where we need you conscious and functional, not passed out at twenty meters."
Amina's eyes narrowed. "Fuck."
"Which means I'm going," Aya said, voice carrying finality. "I know the system best, I've done wreck diving in the Philippines and Vietnam, and I can tell you’ve never dived before or you’d already have volunteered."
"Your wound—" Leyla started.
"Can be managed." Aya turned to her. "You have access to medical supplies in Bodrum, right? Field medic gear?"
"Yes, but—"
"Then get some second skin, a waterproof seal. I’ll apply it over the sutures and create a flexible, waterproof barrier. It won't be comfortable, but it'll hold for a dive."
Leyla studied her for a long moment, then sighed. "You're going to do this regardless of what I say."
"Yes."
"Then yes, I can source that. And antibiotics for after, because that wound is definitely getting contaminated despite our best efforts." She looked at Karim. "You're going with her? You said you're certified?"
"Advanced Open Water," Karim confirmed. "Certified in Dakhla four years ago. Haven't dived since, but I’m sure it's like riding a bicycle. I can refresh the basics, stay close to Aya, follow her lead."
"You'll need to," Leyla said. She pulled up more detailed information on her tablet. "This isn't recreational diving. The chamber is at least twenty meters down, possibly deeper. Strong currents outside the slack tide window. Limited visibility. Confined space entry. This is technical diving without technical training."
"Then we stay conservative," Aya said. "We don't push bottom time, we don't take unnecessary risks, we get in and out during the slack tide window. Twenty minutes maximum."
"And if something goes wrong?" Amina asked, voice tight with the frustration of being sidelined. "If Aya's wound opens, if the current shifts, if you get disoriented in low vis?"
"You’ll be coordinating rescue from the surface," Aya said, meeting her eyes. "We'll have tether lines, underwater lights, and communication signals. You and Leyla will track our position, monitor the current, and watch the clock. That's not a backup role, that's life support."
Amina held her gaze for a moment, then nodded reluctantly. "Fine. But if you die down there because you're too stubborn to acknowledge physical limitations or underestimate me, I'm going to be very angry with your corpse."
"Noted," Aya said. She kept her voice even, but was touched by the concern.
Karim stepped forward, showing the same mix of determination and fear that Aya felt. "So we're decided? Aya and I dive, Amina and Leyla handle surface coordination?"
"We're decided," Leyla confirmed. She made notes on her tablet. "I'll source dive equipment in Bodrum. Two full kits, high-capacity tanks, backup regulators, reef hooks, underwater lights, tether lines, the works. Plus, the materials for Aya's wound and enough antibiotics to fight off whatever infection she's going to come back with."
"Sounds perfect," Aya said, ignoring the way her side throbbed at the thought of pressure changes and physical exertion.
"This is a terrible plan," Amina muttered, but without real protest.
"Most of our plans are terrible," Aya said. "This one's just slightly more dangerous than usual."
"Not reassuring. What if Aegis is down there?" Amina asked.
"Then it gets complicated," Leyla interrupted. "But they'll hopefully still be setting up surveillance, preparing their own team, unsure on the optimal time window and location. Remember, they didn’t recover the detailed charts we found, and they don’t have Hassan’s research. If we hit the window fast and clean, we might be in and out before they realize we've moved."
Might. The word hung in Aya’s mind.
"Before we finalize," Hamza said, his voice cutting through the tactical discussion with unexpected gravity, "you need to understand what you're up against. Not Aegis, that's just resources and firepower. I'm talking about Malik specifically."
The group fell quiet, attention shifting to the old man.
"He learned from your father, Aya. Learned from Hassan's resistance." Hamza's weathered hands gestured slowly, emphasizing his point. "Malik doesn't force anymore; he cultivates. He lets you do the work, then offers partnership when you're exhausted and desperate and facing impossible odds. Every confrontation you've had has been a recruitment pitch disguised as a threat. The cemetery, the safehouse, the mosque. He could have killed you at any of those moments. But he didn't."
"Because he wants the components," Karim said.
"Because he wants you to want to use the components," Hamza corrected. "There's a crucial difference. If he forces you, you're victims. If he convinces you, you're collaborators. Complicit. It changes the narrative from oppressor and oppressed to philosophical disagreement between equals. It makes him right and your father wrong."
Aya grimaced and nodded. "That's why he keeps showing up personally."
"Exactly. He's not there to threaten, he's there to teach. To make his case. To show you that Hassan's fear was misplaced." Hamza looked at each of them in turn. "The Silent Meridian has watched this pattern for centuries. The most dangerous enemies aren't the ones who attack; they're the ones who seduce. Who make oppression look like partnership, who make danger look like opportunity, who make the terrible choice seem reasonable."
"So what do we do?" Amina asked.
"Recognize it for what it is," Hamza said. "He's brilliant. His strategy is sound. If you were ordinary archaeologists, if these were normal components, if the stakes were anything less than catastrophic, he'd probably convince you. Hassan was almost convinced in the early years. That's how good Malik is at making his vision seem inevitable and right."
He placed his hand on the case containing the components. "But you're not ordinary, and the stakes are everything. So you do what Hassan did: you choose principle over persuasion, caution over courage, protection over progress. You choose, knowing that Malik will call it cowardice. And you carry that weight because someone has to."
"As soon as night falls, we roll out," Aya said.
"Yalla," Amina said, banging her hand on the table.
Hamza shifted on the stone bench, wincing as his injured ankle protested. He leaned forward, hands clasped. "Before you all scatter to prepare," he said, looking at each of them in turn, "I want you to understand what you're walking into. What this truly means."
The group fell silent, attention focusing on the old man.
"Hassan died for this," Hamza continued. "My grandfather spent his entire life protecting these secrets. The Silent Meridian has bled for four centuries, keeping this knowledge from the wrong hands. Men and women whose names you'll never know, whose families never understood why they died, who were buried with lies and half-truths because the truth was too dangerous to speak."
His weathered hands gestured to the packs containing the components. "You carry that legacy now. All of you. Every choice you make from this moment forward is measured against centuries of sacrifice. Don't waste it. Don't dishonor it. Don't—"
The sound was almost imperceptible. A distant crack, barely audible over the wind whistling through the cave entrance.
Aya registered it instantly: supersonic round. 
High-powered rifle. Large caliber.
Hamza's head snapped back violently, a fine mist of red spraying across the stone wall behind him. His body remained upright for a single heartbeat, held by momentum and the bench beneath him, then slumped sideways. He collapsed onto the cave floor with an impossibly quiet thump.
For one frozen moment, the universe contracted. Hamza's body sprawled across stone, blood spreading in a dark pool that caught the lamplight and threw it back in crimson reflections.
Then Mehmet screamed.
"DOWN!" Aya roared, already moving, her body reacting before her mind finished processing. She tackled Leyla sideways as a second round cracked through the air. The bullet sparked off the back wall, stone chips exploding outward, the ricochet whining past Amina's head.
Karim grabbed Mehmet, dragging him behind the stone table. The younger man fought against his grip, trying to reach his uncle.
Amina was already in motion, weapon drawn, moving toward the cave entrance in a combat crouch. Another round punched through the opening, forcing her back into cover behind a natural pillar. "Sniper!" she called, pressing herself against the stone. "Long range. Eight hundred meters minimum. Elevated position, southeast ridge."
Aya's hands moved on autopilot, checking Hamza's pulse even though the exit wound at the base of his skull had already told her everything she needed to know. Nothing. No pulse. No breath. No life.
"Mehmet, lights!" Amina shouted. "Kill them all!"
Chapter 32
Mehmet's sister moved with surprising speed for someone in shock. She killed the oil lamps one by one, darkness spreading through the cave like spilled ink. Outside, the last daylight was fading to twilight, shadows deepening across the valley.
"They tracked us," Aya said. "Bastards have been watching. Waiting for everyone to arrive. Waiting for the perfect shot."
"Why just him?" Karim's voice came from the darkness, hollow with horror. "They could have killed all of us. They had time, they had position. Why execute Hamza specifically?"
"Message," Amina said grimly, still scanning the darkening landscape for muzzle flash, for any sign of the shooter. "Showing us they can reach anyone, anywhere. That no one is safe. But still leaving us alive, toying with us, letting us do their work for them."
"Or they needed him dead," Aya said, pieces clicking together with brutal clarity. "He was the keeper. The last direct connection to the Silent Meridian's knowledge of this region. The one person who knew locations, safe houses, and protocols we haven't discovered. They eliminated a strategic asset. Removed him from the board."
Mehmet was making sounds that made Aya's chest ache, the grief and rage and helplessness compressed into wordless heaves. His sister had her arms around him, holding him back from Hamza's body, holding him together, barely holding herself together.
"We have to move," Leyla said, her voice tight. "Sniper means ground team. They'll be closing on this position to confirm the kill, to trap us while we're pinned down."
As if in response, vehicle engines growled in the distance. Multiple engines. Growing louder. Approaching from the access road.
"Mehmet," Aya said, gripping his shoulder hard through the fog of shock. "Look at me. Mehmet, look at me."
His eyes found hers, red and wild and broken.
"I'm sorry," she said. "I am so, so sorry. But we need to get you and your sister away from here. Right now. Is there another exit?"
He stared at her like she was speaking a language he didn't understand. For a moment, she thought he'd simply shut down, would sit with his uncle's corpse and wait for Aegis to arrive. Then something shifted behind his eyes, the same stubborn determination she'd seen in Hamza.
"Northwest exit," he managed, voice raw. “Drops down to the valley. Three kilometers to the village."
"Take it," Aya ordered. "Both of you. Right now. Don't stop, don't look back. When you reach the village, call the authorities. Report a shooting."
"What do I tell them?" Mehmet's voice cracked. "What do I say happened?"
"You were showing your uncle the caves. Someone opened fire without warning. Random violence. You don't know why. You fled. His body is still here. That's the story. That's all you know." Aya hated every word. 
"I can't leave him," Mehmet said, looking at Hamza's body.
"You have to," Aya said firmly. "Your uncle died protecting knowledge from these people. Died protecting us so we could finish the mission. If you stay, if they capture you, they'll torture you for information, things you may not even realize you know. Hamza learned so much from his father and grandfather without even realizing why it was important. Every safe house, every cache, every contact the Silent Meridian has left. You think Hamza would want that?"
Mehmet nodded once, sharp and painful. He pulled away from his sister, moved to Hamza's body, and knelt beside it. He pressed his forehead to his uncle's, whispered something that Aya couldn't hear.
His sister did the same, her own tears falling on Hamza's weathered face.
Then they were moving.
"Components," Aya snapped, already at the table. "Everything we inventoried. Grab it all. We leave together in Leyla's vehicle."
Glass fragment and cylinder into Aya's pack. Calibration rings split between Karim and Leyla. Crystal heart with Amina. Assembly charts divided and distributed.
Through the cave entrance, Aya could see headlights cutting through the dusk, multiple vehicles climbing the distant access road.
"They'll have thermal imaging," Leyla said, checking her pistol, ensuring a round was chambered. "Possibly drones. We can't outrun that in one vehicle on mountain roads."
"So we don't run," Aya said. "We drive like civilians. Lights on, normal speed, looking like we belong here. Two cars. Mehmet's truck going one direction, your rental going another. They don't know which one we're in."
"They'll stop both," Karim said.
"Maybe," Aya agreed. "But Mehmet's story gives us cover. Witnesses heard shots, reported violence, and fled in panic. That's reasonable behavior. We're just terrified tourists who got caught up in something horrible."
"I'll lead, you follow,” Leyla said.
They divided quickly. Leyla took Amina in the SUV. Aya climbed into Mehmet's truck with Karim; the interior smelled of cigarettes and old leather. The engine coughed twice before catching, rougher than the rental but functional.
"Normal speed," Aya reminded through the window.
Both vehicles pulled onto the access road, heading down the mountain, headlights cutting through the growing darkness.
The SUV's headlights illuminated the winding road ahead. Behind them, Cappadocia's fairy chimneys stood indifferent to human grief, standing as they'd stood for millennia while countless lives played out and ended in their shadows.
For the first hour, Karim said nothing. He sat in the passenger seat, hands clenched in his lap, staring at the road ahead as fairy chimneys gave way to rolling hills, then pine forest. Ahead of them, Leyla's SUV maintained a steady distance, taillights marking their path.
Finally, as they descended into a thicker forest and the adrenaline began to wear off, Karim spoke.
"I need to tell you something," he said quietly. "Hamza told me, before—" His voice caught. "Before."
Aya glanced at him, then back to the road. "About my father."
"Yeah." Karim swallowed. "He said Hassan and Malik knew each other, and he’d interacted with them. That they were colleagues before everything went wrong."
The truck's headlights illuminated the winding mountain road, pine trunks flashing past on either side. Aya's hands tightened on the steering wheel.
"You already know they worked together," Karim began, his voice careful. "Those papers you decoded in Istanbul proved the academic collaboration, the years of joint research. But Hamza knew the rest of it. The personal side. Hassan confided in him during those visits to Cappadocia."
Aya's hands tightened on the steering wheel. "What personal side?"
"They met at an archaeology conference in the mid-nineties," Karim continued. "Hassan was presenting research on Ottoman astronomical instruments. Malik was there representing Aegis, a young upstart agent already interested in historical technology with potential applications. They connected over the precision of medieval engineering. Started corresponding."
The highway curved through switchbacks, descending toward sea level. Aya navigated automatically, her mind elsewhere.
"For nearly a decade, they collaborated," Karim said. "Co-authored those papers you found, shared research, built what Hassan thought was a genuine friendship. Until the Cappadocia visit nineteen years ago, when Hassan tried activating a partial system. That was the catastrophe Hamza described. Partial reproduced components, enough to test the principles."
"And he saw something," Aya said quietly. "Through the dimensional fractures."
"Something aware. Intelligent. Waiting." Karim's voice was steady but strained. "After that, Hassan tried to convince Malik to abandon it. Spent months arguing that this wasn't progress, it was opening doors that should stay closed. Malik refused. Saw it as humanity's next great leap forward, proof of technology that could transcend modern limitations and obliterate understandings of science."
"They had a falling out."
"Complete break. Stopped speaking. Hassan went underground and joined the Silent Meridian, or maybe he'd always been part of it. Started hiding components, scattering them across continents, making it impossible for any one person or organization to assemble the complete system. He knew Malik would keep searching indefinitely with Aegis funding. So he dedicated his professional life to keeping the lens fractured, to preventing this type of research."
Karim glanced at Aya. "Hamza said your father visited Cappadocia at least four more times after that initial experiment he worked on. Sometimes staying for weeks, working with Hamza's family on Silent Meridian protocols, encoding hiding places, and establishing fail-safes. They became close. Hassan needed someone who understood what he'd given up by choosing caution. Hamza was that person."
The highway straightened, cutting through a valley where morning mist clung to hollows.
"Hassan talked about Malik constantly those last years," Karim continued. "Not with anger, but with grief. Like he'd lost a brother. That's why Hamza knew so much about Malik's methods, his psychology. Hassan had spent years trying to understand how his closest colleague had become so willing to risk everything."
"What actually ended it?" Aya asked.
Karim nodded slowly. "Apparently, Hassan called Malik from Colombia, not to reconcile, but to warn him one final time. He emailed Hamza about it to warn him that Malik might come to speak to him." He pulled out his phone, found the note he'd written of Hamza’s story. "Hassan had found evidence of a failed activation that left permanent damage. A thin place in reality that still existed eight hundred years later, still leaking energy, still affecting the area. Mutations in local wildlife. Unexplained electromagnetic anomalies. People reporting visions, dissociative episodes."
The car hummed along the empty highway.
"Hassan realized that activation didn't just succeed or fail; it left scars on our world that never healed," Karim said. "He told Malik that the lens isn't a tool for transcendence. It's a weapon that wounds reality itself, and those wounds are permanent." Karim's voice hardened. "Malik said they’d account for those mistakes, control the variables, and achieve clean activation. He said Hassan’s fear was understandable, but not wise. Cowardice."
"He called my father a coward."
Karim shrugged. "Anyway, the conversation ended with Hassan saying: 'If you do this, Malik, you do it without me. And I'll make sure you never get the chance.' Malik's response was silence. Hassan died in a tunnel collapse sixteen hours later."
The implications hung heavy.
"Hamza didn't think it was an accident," Karim said quietly. "But he also said Hassan was working in unstable conditions, taking risks he normally wouldn't because he was desperate to find evidence that would convince Malik to stop. So maybe it was an accident, maybe it was murder, maybe it was Hassan's desperation catching up to him. We'll never know for certain. What we do know is that Malik has spent seven years trying to achieve the clean activation Hassan said was impossible. Trying to show that the fear that ended their friendship, that likely got your father killed, was misplaced."
"This…" Aya took a long moment to process Karim's words. "So my father and Malik weren't just colleagues who disagreed. They were close. Brothers, basically. And Malik did murder him. I could feel it, I knew it."
She gripped the steering wheel tightly in the dashboard light.
"Hamza told me right before we split up in Cappadocia," Karim said quietly.
“Fuck, I wish I could ask him questions. Why wouldn’t he have told me?”
 "He made me promise to wait until after Bodrum to tell you. Didn't want you distracted during the dive, didn't want your anger at Malik affecting your judgment underwater."
Aya nodded slowly. "He was trying to protect the mission. Being a guardian. He was right.”
"Sorry if I should have honored his request. But sitting here, keeping it from you, felt wrong. You deserve to know what Hassan fought for. What Hamza died protecting. What we're still fighting against."
Ahead, Leyla's taillights flashed twice. They were approaching a town, lights visible through the trees. Time to look normal, innocent, push everything else away.
"When we face Malik," Aya said, voice steady, "I want him to know Hassan won. That all his hunting and killing and corporate resources couldn't break what my father built. That Çelebi and Hamza and the guardians held the line."
"They did," Karim said quietly. "Right up until a bullet found Hamza. But now we carry the torch, you carry the torch. Hassan would be proud of what you've done, what you're still doing."
Aya nodded, not trusting herself to speak.
Karim fell silent, staring at the road ahead. His hand moved unconsciously to his pocket, to the small weight he'd been carrying since the workshop.
‘Tell her,’ Hamza had said. Let her decide its fate with the rest. You’re a team.
But now Hamza was dead, killed by the very people they were racing to stop. And Karim found himself wondering: if the wafer was the difference between controlled operation and catastrophic failure, wasn't it safer in his hands? Wasn't it insurance against Malik succeeding even if everything else went wrong?
He opened his mouth to tell Aya. Closed it. Opened it again.
"What?" Aya asked, catching his hesitation.
"Nothing," he said. "Just... thinking about Hamza."
He told himself it was temporary. He'd tell her after Bodrum. After the dive. When they had time to discuss it properly.
Hamza's voice echoed in his memory: This is not your choice to make alone. Karim pushed it down and watched the road.
Chapter 33
They reached Bodrum after dawn had fully broken over the harbor, the city cascading down hillsides toward the harbor in tiers of whitewashed buildings. The Castle of St. Peter dominated the waterfront, a massive Crusader fortress of honey-colored stone, imposing even after six centuries. The marina spread before it, a forest of masts and rigging, luxury yachts bobbing gently in the swell.
Aya slowed as they entered the city proper, navigating through traffic that had thickened considerably. Tourists walked in every direction: couples strolling hand-in-hand, families with children, groups of young travelers with backpacks. The season was ending, but Bodrum still held onto the last clutches of summer crowds, the restaurants and shops doing brisk business despite the calendar inching toward autumn.
"There," Leyla said quietly, nodding toward a black SUV parked near the marina entrance. "Government plates. Two men inside, watching the docks."
Aya spotted them through the flow of pedestrians. Too alert, too focused. They weren't enjoying the view; they were working.
"Hello, Aegis," she confirmed. "Nice official cover."
"Question is whether they’ve figured out specifically what we're after or just covering likely entry points."
Aya pulled Mehmet’s truck into a public parking lot three blocks from the marina, tucking it between a tour bus and a panel van. The Renault SUV followed moments later, Karim finding a spot two rows over. They gathered between the vehicles, speaking quietly.
"They're positioned to watch anyone approaching the marina by vehicle," Amina said. "But they can't watch everyone on foot. There’s way too much tourist traffic."
"We split up," Aya decided. "Pairs, approach from different directions, lose ourselves in the crowds. Meet at the boat. Leyla, which berth?"
"C-17, west side of the marina. Blue and white gulet, twenty-five meters."
They separated into pairs, with Aya and Amina taking the northern approach through the commercial district and Karim and Leyla heading south along the waterfront promenade. Aya watched Karim walk away, his hand finding the strap of his pack, carrying components that could level cities, unsure what he would do with them if given the choice.
She and Amina moved through narrow streets that climbed briefly before descending toward the harbor. The district was a maze of boutiques selling jewelry, beach toys, and clothes, cafés with tables spilling onto cobblestones. Tourist traffic provided perfect cover, and they were just two more women navigating the midday crowds.
But Aya felt exposed in a way she hadn't since Cairo. Her face had been broadcast across social media. The balloon theft had made news, and someone might recognize her, might make the connection, might place a call to authorities who would be very interested in her location.
They reached the marina without incident, entering through a pedestrian gate that led past a harbourmaster's office. Rows of floating docks extended into the harbor, each lined with vessels ranging from small sailing dinghies to massive motor yachts worth millions of euros.
"C-17 is this way," Amina said, reading the berth numbers.
They found Captain Deniz's gulet near the end of the western dock. The vessel was beautifully adorned with teak decking, brass fittings that caught the sun, and a hull painted in classic blue and white stripes. It looked like it had been built decades ago and maintained with obsessive care ever since.
A man stood on the aft deck, coiling rope. Sixties, sun-darkened skin weathered by decades at sea, relaxed eyes that Aya doubted would be surprised by much.
"Captain Deniz?" Aya called from the dock.
He looked up, smiled slightly. "Merhaba, come aboard. Omar's friends are my friends. Though he warned me you bring interesting troubles."
"Yeah, we need discreet transport to a specific offshore site," Aya said. "Diving equipment. And a captain who won't ask questions or talk about us to anyone else."
Deniz's smile didn't change. "Questions I don't ask, then I don't have to lie about the answers later." He gestured toward the dock where the black SUV was visible in the distance. "Those government people showed up yesterday. Asking about divers, about underwater ruins. Making the harbor nervous. But do not worry, I am no fan of the government."
"Do they know specifically where we're going?"
"The ruins they mentioned offshore, many locals know of them. It’s a popular diving spot for adventurous tourists." Deniz shrugged. "But Omar mentioned an underwater tidal chamber? That’s a different story altogether. Few remember those old stories. If they have researchers, they might piece it together. If not, they're just watching and waiting. They didn’t ask enough specifics."
Karim and Leyla arrived minutes later, approaching from the opposite direction. They boarded quickly, Deniz casting off mooring lines immediately, firing up the engine with a short rumble that sent gulls scattering from nearby pilings.
They motored out of the marina at idle speed, Deniz navigating through the dense traffic of ferries heading to Greek islands, tour vessels taking sightseers around the peninsula, and private yachts coming or going. No one paid them particular attention, just another traditional gulet heading out for a day sail.
As they cleared the harbor breakwater and the open water spread before them, Aya felt her tension ease. On the water, they were harder to track, harder to trap, and there were fewer people to spot her face. 
The gulet rose and fell with the gentle Mediterranean swell, wind filling the canvas awning that provided shade over the aft deck.
"Do we go to these ruins, yes? They are three kilometers offshore," Deniz said once they'd cleared the coastal traffic. He gestured toward the horizon, where nothing but blue water was visible. "Twenty-something meters down. The bottom is mixed with rock, sand, and some coral. The current can be tricky."
Aya nodded. “I guess so.”
Deniz opened a hatch, revealing the equipment storage below. Wetsuits in various sizes hung from hooks. BCDs, tanks, and regulators, all neatly organized and clearly well-maintained. Reef hooks, backup regulators, and underwater lights in waterproof cases.
"Standard recreational setup," Deniz explained, "but with modifications for the conditions. Higher-capacity tanks so you'll have extended bottom time if you need it. Reef hooks to anchor against any unexpected current. Two backup regulators per diver because the chamber entrance can be tight. It is better to have redundancy."
Karim examined the equipment, checking pressure gauges, testing the regulator function. "What about visibility?"
"During slack tide, good. Maybe fifteen feet inside the chamber, twenty or more outside in the main ruins area. The water's calm, sediment settles. But if the current picks up, which it will, visibility drops to nothing. You'll be in a washing machine."
Deniz spread a laminated chart on the deck, showing the dive site in detail. Depth contours, compass bearings, and notable features marked in waterproof ink.
"We’ll approach from the east," he said, tracing the route. "Follow this reef line down. It drops in stages. You'll hopefully find any tidal chamber somewhere around there." He tapped a specific point. "Look for a natural cave mouth, maybe two meters wide. That'll be your entry."
"Navigation underwater?" Amina asked, studying the chart with professional focus.
"They’ll have compasses. Not complicated if conditions are good. But you need to time it perfectly. Slack tide is at 4 AM tomorrow. Twenty minutes, maybe twenty-five if we're lucky. That's your window."
"What happens if we're inside when the current picks up?" Karim asked.
Deniz met his eyes. "Don't be. Tidal chambers fill and empty with the tide cycle. When the current flows in, it pushes water through that narrow entrance with incredible force. You'd be pinned against the back wall, unable to exit, waiting for the cycle to reverse."
"How long is the full cycle?" Leyla asked.
"Twelve hours from slack to slack. If you miss the window tomorrow morning, the next safe entry is tomorrow evening. I’m chilling, but I think you don't have that kind of time."
“So that’s it,” Aya said. “One chance. Twenty minutes. Everything is riding on precision timing. The crown lens will be there, protected by time and tide, waiting for someone who understands the rhythms well enough to retrieve it.” 
Amina punched Aya and Karim both on the shoulder. “The two of you have this, no problem at all. But I’d kill to be down there and have your backs.”
Deniz killed the engine, and they drifted on the open water, rising and falling in the rolling waves. The coast of Bodrum was visible in a line of white buildings against distant green hills.
“Alright,” Karim said. “Who wants to go over diving again with me? It’s been a while.”
“I did not hear that,” Deniz said as he retreated to the steering wheel. “I’m finding somewhere to anchor nearby that isn’t too conspicuous. After you do what you have to do, keep up appearances just in case, and act like tourists. Swim, snorkel, sunbathe. I’ll prepare dinner.”
Chapter 34
The gulet rocked gently in the afternoon swells as Aya and Amina worked to give Karim a diving refresher. The sun beat down from a cloudless sky, heat radiating off the teak deck, the Mediterranean stretching in all directions, blindingly blue.
"Okay," Amina said, checking Karim's BCD for the third time. "Show me how you clear your regulator if it floods."
Karim sat at the edge of the dive platform, legs dangling in water. He demonstrated the technique with a sharp exhale through the regulator, clearing water from the mouthpiece.
"Good. Now, buddy breathing. Your air runs out, I'm your backup. What do you do?"
"Signal you," Karim said, making the throat-cutting gesture that meant out of air. "Take your backup regulator, purge it, breathe."
"Show me."
They worked through the drills. Emergency ascents. Buoyancy control. Mask clearing. Compass navigation. Karim’s muscle memory slowly returned under Amina's coaching.
"You're doing fine," Amina said after an hour. "Rusty, but competent. You'll remember the rest once you're down there."
"What if I don't?" Karim asked quietly.
"Then I'll handle it," Aya said with a soft smile. "That's why we dive in teams. Nobody's alone down there."
Aya sat in the shade of the awning, watching Karim regain confidence was reassuring. Watching him depend on Amina created a knot in her chest she didn't want to examine.
Around them, the Mediterranean stretched impossibly blue, a shade between turquoise and sapphire that didn't exist anywhere but the Aegean. The water was so clear that Aya could see the sandy bottom fifteen meters down, every ripple distinct, every piece of broken shell. Other boats dotted the horizon with white hulls and tall masts, some under sail, others anchored like their gulet. The hills behind Bodrum rose golden and brown, terraced with olive trees and dotted with white villas that caught the afternoon light.
Deniz appeared from below with cold beers and a suggestion. "You want to look like tourists? Actually be tourists for a few hours. Swim. Snorkel. Enjoy the water. Those government people are watching the harbor through binoculars. Give them something boring to see."
"Right on," Aya said. She looked at Amina. "Feel like a swim?"
"Always."
Aya dove from the platform, the brief moment of freefall followed by the plunge into blue, bubbles roaring past as she descended three meters before kicking back toward light. The water was perfect. Cool enough to be refreshing against sun-heated skin, warm enough that entering it felt like slipping into silk.
She surfaced, shaking water from her hair, and found Amina already in, floating on her back. The afternoon sun painted her olive skin in gold, caught the silver tattoos that traced from shoulder to fingertips.
Karim entered more cautiously, climbing down the ladder rather than diving. Aya could tell he was still preoccupied by the impending dive.
"Relax," Amina called to him. "This is the calm before the storm."
They swam without purpose, lazing about in the dense saltwater, diving to touch the sandy bottom, chasing fish that scattered at their approach, and floating in the gentle current.
Aya found herself drawn to watching Amina move through the water. Her strong legs kicking, body undulating with each stroke, the way she'd surface with water streaming from her hair. The way her one-piece swimsuit was cut high on her hips, water turning it darker, making it cling even tighter.
"Race you to the anchor line," Amina said, already kicking away before Aya could respond.
Aya followed, diving deep and kicking hard, lungs starting to burn by the time she touched the chain. Amina was already there, grinning in victory, bubbles streaming from her mouth as she headed back toward the light.
From below, Aya watched Amina's body move in slow motion against the water, back arching with each kick, swimsuit riding up even higher on her hips. Fifteen meters of crystal water turned her into something ethereal, Amina’s body backlit by afternoon sun, every detail sharp in impossible clarity.
They surfaced together, breathing hard, Amina's shoulder brushing Aya's as they treaded water.
"Still got it," Amina said.
"You cheated. Started before me."
"That's a tactical advantage." Amina's grin was unrepentant. "If you know you can’t win, find a way to change the rules. You taught me that."
They floated there, faces inches apart, water lapping between them.
"We should head back," Aya blurted out suddenly, voice rougher than intended. "Sun's getting lower."
Amina held her gaze for a moment longer than necessary. "Yeah. We should."
Neither of them moved immediately.
Then Karim called from the boat, suggesting rest and asking about dinner plans. The moment broke.
They swam back separately. Amina reached the ladder first, gripped the rails, and pulled herself up. While she climbed, Aya treaded water directly behind her, checking the horizon, adjusting her swimsuit straps, and studying the boat's hull with sudden fascination. Anything to avoid watching the stretch of fabric and expanses of exposed skin still dripping saltwater.
By the time Aya finally hauled herself up the ladder, Amina had already moved to the towels Deniz had laid out, wringing water from her hair, and moving to lie out in the sun.


By the time the sun descended toward the western horizon, the smell of grilled fish and charcoal permeated the air. Aya and Amina retreated to deck chairs, letting the last warmth soak into skin that smelled of salt and sunscreen. Karim had gone below to study his dive charts again, seeking comfort in preparation.
Leyla emerged from the cabin where she'd spent most of the afternoon, face carefully neutral. She caught Aya's eye briefly, unspoken communication passing between them, then retreated below.
"She's become distant," Amina observed quietly.
"She's intelligence trained," Aya said. "Probably compartmentalizing."
The sun touched the horizon, seemed to pause there, then slipped below in the sudden way of Mediterranean sunsets, light to dusk in minutes with no prolonged twilight.
Deniz appeared on deck, wiping his hands on a towel. "Food's ready. Come eat before it gets cold."
They ate on the aft deck under strings of lights Deniz had hung from the rigging. The night air was cool against skin still warm from the afternoon sun.
The meal was simple: fresh fish that flaked perfectly under fork pressure, bread for soaking up olive oil and lemon, olives, cheese, and tomatoes sliced thick. After days of running, of eating standing up or in vehicles or not at all, the ritual of sitting around a table felt almost ceremonial.
No one spoke much. The exhaustion of the past week was catching up, making conversation feel like too much effort. They ate with the single-minded focus of people who'd pushed their bodies past reasonable limits, who knew another test was coming in hours, who wanted to feel normal for just a few more minutes.
Karim finished first, excused himself quietly, and disappeared into the forward cabin with his notebook. Aya watched him go, saw the tension in his shoulders.
Leyla silently followed suit, heading into her cabin with a solemn look affixed to her face.
That left Aya and Amina alone with Deniz, who was already standing and clearing plates.
"Big operation later," he said. "You guys should rest. I’ll take care of these."
"Thanks. Yeah," Aya agreed, though rest felt impossible. "We should."
But neither of them moved immediately. They sat in the gentle rocking of the boat, watching stars emerge in overwhelming profusion, the Milky Way a river of light overhead. To the north, the lights of Bodrum's harbor glowed softly against the hills. Behind them, the darker silhouettes of other anchored boats rocked in perfect synchronization with their own, halyards clinking against masts in a rhythm like distant bells.
"Tomorrow's going to be interesting," Amina said finally. "Underwater, limited visibility, narrow spaces. Perfect conditions for everything to go wrong."
"We've both done harder dives," Aya said.
"True. But never with stakes this high." Amina's hand found her water glass, traced condensation on the outside. "Never with the knowledge that if we fail, Malik wins. That he activates something that could give the most evil people we know a stranglehold on global energy, undoing everything we sacrificed in Morocco. Or tear holes in reality. Or both."
“We won't fail," Aya said with more confidence than she felt.
"But you're worried about Karim."
It wasn't a question. Aya didn't pretend otherwise.
"He's got so little diving experience," she admitted. "And it's more than that. He's getting too invested in the preservation question. Starting to sound like he's rationalizing reasons to study the lens rather than destroy it."
"Academics fall in love with their subjects," Amina said. "It's what makes them good at what they do. Also, what makes them dangerous when the subject is dangerous." She looked at Aya directly. "But you can't pull him back from that edge on your own. He has to choose for himself."
They sat in silence as the last light faded completely, leaving only afterglow and stars and the gentle phosphorescence in the water where fish disturbed the surface. The Mediterranean was so calm it reflected the stars perfectly, above and below, light doubling, making it feel like floating in space rather than anchored on water. Small waves lapped in irregular rhythm.
"Hamza would have loved this," Amina said quietly, breaking the silence. "Mehmet told me he used to take his grandchildren fishing off Antalya every summer."
Aya's chest tightened. They hadn't spoken about it since the escape, all of them carrying the weight privately. "He deserved better than dying in a cave, talking about legacy."
"He got exactly what he wanted," Amina replied. "Died protecting what mattered, surrounded by people continuing his work. Most people don't get that." She paused. "My grandfather died in a hospital, machines beeping, fluorescent lights. He would have preferred Hamza's way."
"Doesn't make it fair."
"No," Amina agreed. "But fair stopped being relevant a long time ago. We're just trying to make his death mean something."
They fell silent again, the words settling over them like the darkness.
"Tomorrow when you're underwater," Amina said finally, "trust me to hold things down topside. I know I'm not the mystical compass anymore. But I'm still good at this. I'll keep everyone safe."
"I know," Aya said. And she did.
Aya and Amina sat in comfortable silence, both avoiding the moment when they'd have to retreat to separate spaces, when the illusion of normalcy would end, and reality would reassert itself.
Deniz finished cleaning, then disappeared below with a muttered goodnight. As he disappeared into his own cabin, Aya retreated to the forward cabin, hoping Karim might be asleep. 
He wasn't.
Karim was lying on his back in the narrow berth, staring at the cabin ceiling, notebook and pen resting on his chest. The single overhead light cast harsh shadows that made his face look older, more worn than his thirty-two years.
"Hey," Aya said quietly, closing the door behind her.
"Hey." He didn't look up.
The silence stretched. Aya stood awkwardly in the confined space, uncertain whether to stay or leave. The cabin felt smaller than it had that morning, the air thicker.
"You've been distant," Karim said finally.
"I'm focused," Aya replied, moving to sit on the edge of the berth. "Big dive in hours."
"It's more than that." He turned onto his side, looking at her with eyes that had always been too perceptive for comfort. "We used to talk. Really talk. Now it's just logistics and planning and avoiding."
Aya wanted to deny it, but couldn't. "Things are complicated, but I don’t feel like you’ve been very open with me either. I’m not sure what happened."
"Are we okay?" The question came out smaller than he'd intended.
"Are we?" Aya turned it back.
"You tell me."
"I don't know how to answer that."
"That's the problem," Karim said, frustration breaking through. "I used to be certain about us. Now I’m not, and you’re not either. I don’t know what happens after all this ends. It feels like it’ll never end. We’ve been fighting and surviving for months. I don’t know how long I can do this."
He sat up suddenly, closing the distance between them. "Maybe we just need to—" He kissed her before finishing the thought, choosing physical connection over words.
Aya kissed him back, aware of how mechanical it felt even as she did it, fueled by little desire.
He pulled her closer with something that felt like desperation, hands pulling off her shirt, trying to prove something to both of them through touch when words had failed.
She responded the way she thought she should, hands on his shoulders, but her mind stayed detached. Going through the motions, performing rather than feeling. And she could tell he knew it, could feel it in the way his movements became more urgent, more insistent, like he was trying to force a connection that wasn't there. And she knew he felt the same; it was in his eyes.
"Karim—" she started to pull back.
"Please." His voice was rough. "Just... let's just try."
But trying was the problem. Trying meant they were both pretending.
His hands moved across her skin with increasing urgency, mouth on her neck, breath coming faster. But there was no heat in it. Just two people desperately attempting to resurrect something that had died without either of them noticing when.
She pulled back more firmly. "This isn't working."
He froze, then sat back hard, running both hands through his hair. "No. It's not."
The admission hung between them.
"When did we—" Aya started.
"I don't know." Karim's voice carried exhaustion and something like relief. "Somewhere between Morocco and here. Maybe before. Maybe it never really worked, and we were just too busy surviving to notice."
"That's not true. It was good once."
"It was. Better than good." He looked at her. "But were we just convenient for each other? Two people caught in the same chaos, looking for something stable to hold onto?"
Aya opened her mouth to argue, but couldn't find words to counter his, because deep down she feared he might be right.
"I think—" Karim stopped, then started again. "I think we've been holding onto what we thought we should be. What looked right on paper. The timid scholar and the recovering thief turned into action heroes. Makes a good story."
"Karim—"
"But you're not here anymore," he continued, voice steady despite everything. "You're somewhere else. Someone else. And I've been pretending not to notice because admitting it meant admitting I picked wrong. That I followed you into all this danger for something that was already ending."
"I never meant—"
"I know." He turned away, facing the cabin wall. "Neither of us did. But that doesn't change what is. We’re both feeling the same thing."
They lay in the narrow berth, not touching despite the confined space. Both awake. Both aware that words, once spoken, couldn’t be taken back.
"I'm sorry," Aya said quietly.
"So am I." Karim's voice was barely audible.
After an hour of pretending to sleep, Aya gave up. She slipped from the cabin carefully, climbed the ladder to the deck, where the air felt less suffocating, and the stars seemed less oppressive than the silence below.
She found Amina already there, knees bent, leaning against the mast, looking at stars reflected on dark water.
"Couldn't sleep either?" Aya asked.
"Body clock remembers dive schedules," Amina replied without turning. "My adrenaline's already starting to spike for you guys."
Aya sat beside her, leaving careful space and settling into silence. The same careful space they'd been maintaining for weeks, the same pretense that proximity didn't matter.
Above them, stars wheeled in their ancient patterns. Around them, water lapped gently against the hull, the sound hypnotic and eternal.
"What do you want, Aya?" Amina asked finally, voice quiet but direct. “You never answered me.”
"I don't know anymore."
"Yes, you do." Amina turned to look at her.
They sat in silence, Aya growing hyperaware of Amina beside her, the way she smelled of salt and sunscreen. She hadn’t come looking for her, but here they found each other. This was the moment to leave, to maintain the boundary. To think about Karim sleeping twenty feet away, about the comfortable relationship that made sense.
But Aya had spent months doing what she should do, being who she should be, choosing the life that looked right on paper, looked like salvation after years of questionable morals. And she was exhausted from it.
"I'm not asking you to choose or make any declarations," Amina said quietly. "Not tonight. I just—"
She stopped, whatever she was going to say dying as they looked at each other.
The moment extended, tension building until it was unbearable, until maintaining the careful distance felt more dishonest than closing it.
Aya knew Karim deserved better. Knew she'd regret this. But she leaned in anyway.
The kiss was gentle, questioning, giving Amina the chance to pull back. Then it exploded. Weeks of denial, tension. Years of unresolved history combusting. Amina's hand in Aya's hair, pulling her closer. Aya's hands gripping Amina's waist, then sliding under her shirt, finding warm skin that felt like coming home.
It was a betrayal, but it also felt real in a way nothing had felt real in as long as Aya could remember, like being herself without apology or performance.
Then they were kissing deeper, guilt and desire warring until desire won. Amina's back was against the mast, Aya pressed against her, hands relearning exactly how they fit together. How Amina tasted. How she made sounds low in her throat at Aya’s touch.
They broke apart suddenly, both breathing hard.
Aya pulled back further, pressing her spine against the opposite side of the mast. "We can't. Karim is right there."
"I know." Amina's voice was rough, but she didn't move closer. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have—"
"It wasn't you." Aya's hands were shaking. "It's me. I wanted—" She stopped, couldn't finish.
They sat in charged silence. The guilt was crushing. Just the deck and a ladder and a thin cabin wall between this moment and Karim sleeping, unaware. The man who'd followed her into danger. Who deserved honesty at minimum, decency at least. She needed to talk to him first.
But the longing was crushing too. Years of it, suppressed and rationalized and carefully ignored. And now here it was, unavoidable.
"We should stop," Aya said, not moving.
"We should," Amina agreed, not moving either.
The moment stretched, and Aya could feel the weight of the choice pressing down.
Then footsteps sounded on the ladder below.
Deniz's head appeared briefly, checking on the anchor watch. “All good up here?” he called.
“Just can’t sleep,” Aya said.
He nodded. “I get it. Well, take care.”
There was a long silence after he disappeared below. Aya could still feel everywhere they'd been pressed together.
"That can't happen again," Aya said, voice unsteady.
"Okay," Amina replied.
Neither of them believed it.
Aya stood frozen another moment, torn between going back to Amina and going below. Every instinct screamed to finish what they'd started, to stop pretending she wanted anything else.
Aya went below and took the settee berth in the salon, lying awake. She couldn't face Karim right now. Not because the relationship was dead, that was true, but it didn't excuse it. Because she'd been a coward and should have been honest. 
She couldn't lie beside him with Amina's taste still in her mouth, with the phantom of her touch still lingering on her skin, with the certainty of what Aya wanted finally crystal clear, no more pretending.
At 3:30 AM, an alarm would sound. They'd suit up. She and Karim would descend into darkness to retrieve something that could save or doom them all. Amina would stay topside, watching them disappear, all carrying the certainty that everything was about to change. If the dive didn't kill them first.

Chapter 35
The alarm shattered what little peace the pre-dawn hours had offered. 3:30 AM came too soon and not soon enough. Aya woke on the salon settee, body stiff, mouth dry, conscience screaming. She lay still for a moment, remembering. She could still feel the way her body had responded with an honesty that made everything else feel like lying. And that was the worst part. Not that she'd done it, but that it had felt right.
On deck, Deniz was already checking equipment with methodical efficiency, his weathered hands moving over regulators and gauges.
The pre-dawn air carried the salt-mineral smell of the Mediterranean.
Karim emerged from the forward cabin, not looking at Aya, moving carefully, slowly. He had his wetsuit pulled up to his waist already, the neoprene creased from where he'd stored it. His hair stuck up at odd angles from restless sleep.
"Morning," Aya said, voice rough from too little sleep. She'd left last night, and she hadn't gone back.
"Morning," Karim replied, still not looking, busying himself with his dive computer, checking settings he'd already verified twice the night before.
Amina emerged from the aft berth, silent. She moved to her own gear and began her pre-dive checks, not acknowledging the tension crackling through the small space.
Deniz ran through emergency procedures again, current patterns, what to do if separated, and how to abort if conditions became unsafe. His dark eyes moved between Aya and Karim, noting the careful distance they maintained, saying nothing.
"Slack tide starts 4:05 AM," he said, checking his watch against the tide tables he'd printed and laminated, covered in pencil notations. "Twenty minutes, maybe twenty-two if the wind stays light. After that, the current picks up fast. You need to be topside before 4:30, understand?"
They both nodded.
Suiting up required a certain intimacy, as they checked each other’s gear. Karim moved behind Aya to test her tank connections, his fingers testing the O-ring seal, ensuring the first stage regulator was properly secured, avoiding eye contact even though his face was inches from hers.
Four years of rust showed in the way he had to consciously think through each step. He rotated the valve, testing air flow, then did it again as if unsure he'd done it correctly the first time. Finally satisfied, he gave her shoulder strap a tug that was perhaps too hard, overcompensating.
"Hamza was right," Karim said quietly as he checked her shoulder straps. "About the crown lens being critical. About Hassan understanding what he was protecting." He paused, hands still on her gear. "I should have told you earlier. About Hassan and Malik. I'm sorry."
"I know why you didn't," Aya said, and meant it. "But we're even now. No more secrets."
"No more secrets," he agreed.
Something passed between them, not quite romance but understanding. Respect. The acknowledgment that they'd both been trying to protect each other in their own flawed ways, that they'd both made mistakes, that moving forward meant accepting those failures and choosing better.
"Are we good?" Karim asked quietly. 
"We're good," Aya said, the words feeling like glass in her throat.
"Breathe," he instructed.
Aya took a breath from her regulator. Air flowed smoothly, tasting of the rubber mouthpiece and the faintly metallic tang of compressed gas. She gave him the okay sign.
She turned to check his setup, adjusted the shoulder straps of his BCD, and tested his air pressure gauge. The needle sat at 3000 PSI. A full tank, good for forty minutes at depth if he controlled his breathing. Their hands didn't touch as she worked. Both were being careful about that, maintaining the millimeters of professional contact.
"Are we good?" Karim asked quietly.
"We're good," Aya said, unsure if he meant anything beyond their gear.
At 4:03 AM, as the sky began shifting from black to deep purple in the east, they entered the water.
The cold was shocking despite their wetsuits. Dark water closed over Aya’s head, only their headlamp beams cutting through the blue-black, creating narrow tunnels of visibility that ended in absolute darkness.
They descended the anchor line together, Aya leading, Karim following three meters behind. Hand over hand down the rope, the nylon felt rough even through her neoprene gloves. 
At ten meters, the residual surface light faded completely. At twenty meters, they existed in a small bubble of lamplight entombed by infinite darkness, the beams catching suspended particles that drifted past like snow.
Fish scattered from their lights, silver flashes that were there and gone, bream or sea bass, impossible to identify in the brief glimpse.
Aya forced herself to focus, tuning out all personal distractions. The dive required full attention, with no room for guilt or second-guessing or replaying the kiss with Amina over and over. Just the immediate reality of depth and pressure and nitrogen loading slowly in her blood, creating the underwater narcosis that could kill you if you weren't careful, that could make you think you were fine as you made decisions that would drown you.
After another few meters down, the structure emerged from the darkness like something from a dream.
Marble, Greco-Roman columns lay broken but precisely fitted, the stone still showing chisel marks after two thousand years. Each column was fluted, the classical style, but now covered in a thin layer of marine growth that gave them a fuzzy, softened appearance. 
Modifications became visible as they descended. Brick additions arched between the ancient pillars, creating a hybrid structure that spoke of different empires, different purposes, layers of civilization stacked like geological time.
The beauty struck Aya even through her professional focus. She knew this was what Karim loved, the layering of history, the way each culture built on what came before rather than destroying it. She glanced back at him, saw his eyes wide behind his mask, his head turning slowly to take it all in. Even in the middle of a mission, even with everything broken between them, he couldn't help but marvel at the architecture, couldn't help but see the human story written in stone. And part of her loved it.
The structure was far larger than expected, more imposing. An octagonal seal was set into a stone doorframe, each panel carved with star patterns that matched workshop diagrams they’d been seeing as they uncovered pieces of Çelebi’s network across Turkey. 
The central star was eight-pointed, radiating lines creating the sunburst effect. Around it, smaller stars formed constellation patterns. Pleiades, Orion's belt, and the Southern Cross. Three mounting points for calibration rings stood out from the surface, brass fittings that gleamed even after centuries underwater, the metal somehow immune to corrosion.
Aya removed the two brass rings from her waterproof pouch, handling them carefully despite thick neoprene gloves that made her fingers clumsy. The first ring, the one marked with lunar phases around its circumference, fit into the top mounting point. She had to rotate it slightly to find the alignment, the mechanism resisting before clicking into place with a vibration she felt through her gloves. The sound carried through the water, a pure tone like striking crystal.
The second ring, planetary orbits etched into its surface, went into the right-hand mount. This one seated smoothly, and as it locked, Aya felt something shift in the water around them. Not movement but pressure, as if the ocean itself was holding its breath.
Suddenly, the weight of their depth felt heavier, growing.
The third mounting point remained empty, save for deeply grooved markings. Aya moved closer, her lamp illuminating symbols carved around the mount's perimeter. Not decorative, but instructional. Numbers, and a phrase in Turkish that she couldn't read but photographed.
She signaled to Karim, pointing at the inscription. He swam closer, his lamp joining hers, studying the text. Behind his mask, she could make out his eyes narrowing in the faint glow.
After a few moments of study, he pulled out his dive slate and wrote: "Turn rings to align stars with cardinal directions, I think.”
He quickly erased, then wrote again: “Third mount opens when pattern matches this exact moment. Barrier of knowledge."
Aya looked at the two rings they'd already installed. She'd thought they just locked in place, but now she saw they could rotate within their mounts. Each ring had tiny hash marks along its edge, degree markings. She grabbed the first ring, tried to turn it. 
Resistance, then slow movement. The ring rotated smoothly, bronze on bronze, mechanisms that had waited four centuries beneath the water, but still functioned.
But turn it to what position? Aya thought. Shit. She looked to Karim and shook her head. The narcosis was making her head feel like it was full of honey.
He wrote again: "Eight-pointed star = eight directions? Star tip must point to true north."
Aya oriented herself using her dive compass, found magnetic north. She rotated the first ring, watching as the eight-pointed star etched on its face turned. When the primary tip aligned with true north, she felt something shift. A vibration through her gloves, subtle but present.
The second ring required yet another different alignment. Karim studied the orbits etched into its surface, made calculations on his slate, numbers and angles. Finally, he wrote: "Venus’ position at the winter solstice. 73 degrees from north."
Aya rotated the second ring, counting hash marks, stopping at 73 degrees. Another vibration, stronger this time. 
The water pressure around them shifted with a pulse of whatever was within, becoming heavier.
The third mounting point began to glow, a faint phosphorescence coming from within the stone itself. The empty mount was now showing them what it needed: a shadow, a void, a specific absence.
Karim studied it. He wrote: "Not weight. Shadow. Block light at exact angle."
His hand shook slightly from the effort of maintaining neutral buoyancy. His fins kicked unconsciously, small adjustments that showed he was fighting the current more than he should be. Aya saw him glance at his depth gauge twice, then his air gauge, checking and rechecking.
He’ll be alright. He’s made it this far, Aya told herself. She held up her hands. “What angle?”
Karim shook his head, and they were both left to stare at the mount. Finally, he removed his dive knife and positioned it above the glowing mount, casting a shadow. 
Too far left. Nothing. 
Too far right. Nothing. 
He adjusted carefully, rotating the knife's angle, moving it millimeter by millimeter until the shadow fell across the mount in different patterns. The glow intensified where shadow met light, creating a key of darkness against illumination.
Click.
The sound was definitive, mechanical, utterly certain. Hidden bronze hinges activated somewhere deep in the stone, mechanisms that had waited for this specific combination: aligned rings, correct angles, shadow cast at precise position during slack tide when water pressure equalized.
The door swung inward slowly, fighting water pressure and centuries of disuse, but still functional, still perfect in its engineering.
Beyond the seal was a small, octagonal reliquary room.
Aya's lamp swept across the space, revealing details that made her breath catch. The mosaic floor was intact, depicting constellation patterns rendered in colored stone. Blue for the night sky, gold for the stars, each tiny tile no larger than her thumbnail. The precision was staggering. Someone had spent months, maybe years, creating this floor that would be seen by perhaps a handful of people before being sealed away and sunk into the ocean.
And at the center, on a golden shelf that rose from the mosaic floor, Aya saw what they were looking for. It had to be. The crown lens.
It was the size of a large fist, crystal worked in impossible internal complexity, facets within facets, like looking into a kaleidoscope. Abstract patterns that seemed to shift as light passed through, creating three-dimensional structures that couldn't exist in normal glass. Every surface was etched with microscopic calculations, formulas too small to make out without magnification.
Aya swam closer, her lamp beam hitting the lens and—
The light fractured.
Not randomly, but into structured rainbow patterns that splashed across the chamber walls. Colors too pure, too saturated to be natural refraction. The blue wasn't just blue; it was every shade of blue simultaneously, from pale sky to deep indigo, all existing in the same space. And the light didn't just bend, it seemed to organize itself, finding patterns that shouldn't exist, creating geometries that made her eyes hurt when she tried to follow them.
Aya's vision began to swim. She'd experienced nitrogen narcosis before, knew the drunk feeling, the slowed thoughts. This was different. The patterns on the walls wouldn't hold still. They shifted when she wasn't looking directly at them, reorganized themselves in her peripheral vision, creating movement that made her inner ear scream, insisting she was tilting when she knew she was level. 
Her eyes couldn’t focus.
She reached for the wall to steady herself but missed on the first try, her depth perception suddenly unreliable. Her hand passed through space where she'd been certain stone existed. She tried again, connected, felt solid rock beneath her glove.
Her regulator was still feeding good air. Her dive computer was showing safe depth, safe nitrogen levels, everything normal. But her body was responding to something the instruments couldn't measure.
She forced herself to look away from the lens, focused on Karim instead. Solid. Real. Not shifting. Her equilibrium slowly returned, the vertigo fading but not disappearing completely, leaving a residue of wrongness that made her want to surface, to escape whatever the lens was doing to her perception.
She signaled with a thumbs-up and a head jerk to Karim. Photograph quickly, then cover it. 
He understood immediately, seeing her unsteadiness, moving to secure the lens in its padded bag while she forced herself to breathe slowly, to ride out whatever effect the refracted light was having on her nervous system.
An object of sublimely terrifying beauty and power.
Looking at it, Aya understood why Çelebi had hidden it. Why the Silent Meridian kept it secret. This wasn't just a lens. It was a key to something humans weren't ready to unlock, maybe would never be ready to unlock. Perhaps more based in scientific method than the djinn they’d awoken in Morocco, but no less powerful. No less potential for misuse and destruction.
Aya photographed the chamber with the underwater camera. The walls, the floor, the pedestal, the crown lens from every angle. Flash bursts illuminated the space in brief, brilliant intervals, each one revealing details invisible in their lamp beams: subtle variations in the mosaic patterns, wear marks on the pedestal, tool marks in the stone.
Karim swam slowly around the perimeter and paused at one section to Aya’s left, his hand hovering over a series of calculations, reading, his lips moving slightly behind his regulator.
He pulled out his dive slate. "Try not to look into the lens directly."
Aya read his translation, understanding why her equilibrium had failed when she'd stared at the fractured light too long. She'd looked. Something had looked back.
Karim continued around the chamber, photographing inscriptions with his own camera, the flashes creating strobing illumination. He was documenting every inch, unable to leave without preserving the knowledge.
Aya understood the impulse even as it made her anxious. Someone did need to understand what Çelebi had built. But whether that someone should be them, whether this knowledge should be preserved or destroyed, she still didn't know the answer.
The stabilization component from Cappadocia flashed across his mind. He should have told Aya about it already. Should have confessed what he'd taken from the workshop while they fled from Aegis. But watching her now, seeing how she documented everything with clinical precision and prepared to hide it all away, preparing to let this incredible knowledge disappear again, he couldn't bring himself to admit he'd saved a piece, perhaps the most interesting of them all.
Later, he told himself. After we stop Malik. Then I'll decide what to do with it. Then I'll tell her.
While Karim secured the crown lens in a padded bag clipped to his BCD, Aya swam back to the doorway where the calibration rings remained mounted.
She gripped the first ring, the one marked with lunar phases, and tried to rotate it counterclockwise. Resistance. The bronze had seated itself in the mechanism, creating friction. She pulled harder, her thick neoprene gloves making it difficult to maintain grip on the smooth metal. Finally, it gave, unscrewing with a grinding sensation she felt through her hands. She secured it in her waterproof pouch.
The second ring fought her even more. The planetary orbits etched into its surface gave her nothing to grip. She had to work her gloved fingers underneath its edge, prying and rotating simultaneously. Thirty seconds of wrestling before it released. Into the pouch with the first.
As she sealed the pouch, the water movement changed around them.
It was subtle at first, just a shift in how the current pushed against Aya's body, the way suspended particles began drifting with purpose instead of floating. 
Then it became more pronounced, the pull becoming insistent, the Mediterranean beginning its twice-daily rush as the tide turned.
The chamber began swirling in a slow current, as water pressure poured through ventilation channels cut high in the walls. Water swirling with more force now, creating eddies and counter-currents that pulled at their fins.
Deniz's voice crackled over their underwater comm system, slightly distorted by water and distance: "Current picking up topside. Need to surface soon. You've got maybe five minutes before it becomes dangerous."
Aya signaled ascent, thumb pointed up. Karim nodded, following as they swam toward the chamber entrance, fighting the current now, having to kick hard to make progress. His lamp flickered, and he fumbled with it, trying to tap it back to life, before giving up and relying on Aya's light.
They reached the doorway and pulled themselves through, grabbing the stone frame for leverage as the current tried to sweep them past. Outside the chamber, the full force of the tide hit them. It was no longer subtle, no longer a gentle pull, but something insistent that required constant swimming just to maintain position.
They had to fight toward the anchor line, swimming at an angle to make progress, the rope visible as a pale vertical line in Aya's lamp beam. Her legs burned with the effort, her breathing rate climbing, burning through air far faster than she wanted. Behind her, Karim's exhaust bubbles came faster too, irregular.
She signaled to him when they reached the line: ascend slowly. He nodded, breathing hard. They'd burned through air fighting the current, and they still had a safety stop ahead.
They began pulling themselves up hand over hand, the current still strong but lessening as they rose. 
The old knife wound in her side flared with each movement, the scar tissue protesting the exertion, the BCD's waist strap digging into exactly the wrong spot. She'd been favoring it unconsciously, compensating with her right side, and now both her obliques screamed in protest, and for a moment, fear cut through the exhaustion. What if the stitches hadn't held? She pushed the thought away. No choice but to keep moving. 
At twelve meters, Aya's dive computer began beeping. Ascent rate warning. She was climbing too fast, pushed by adrenaline and fear. She forced herself to slow, count to three between pulls, regulate her breathing despite every instinct screaming to reach the surface, to reach air and safety.
At eight meters, the current eased further. At six meters, it became merely annoying rather than dangerous. Aya's computer showed their target: five meters depth, three-minute safety stop mandatory. Skip it and risk decompression sickness. Follow protocol and risk running out of air or being swept away if the current picked up again.
She checked her pressure gauge: 700 PSI. Maybe ten minutes of air at this depth if she stayed calm. Karim's gauge showed worse: 500 PSI. They'd pushed their bottom time too long, and fighting the current had burned through their reserves.
At five meters, they stopped, wrapping their arms around the anchor line, locking their bodies in place. At least there’s still no sign of Malik, she thought.
Chapter 36
The ascent couldn't be direct. Nitrogen buildup at their depth required staged decompression or they'd get the bends, nitrogen bubbles forming in their blood and joints, causing pain, paralysis, and possibly death. A safety stop at five meters would be mandatory, three minutes watching their dive computers count down while the current tried to rip them away from the anchor line, their oxygen supplies diminished, and Aegis invariably gained ground.
They gripped the rope with both hands, bodies streaming horizontally in the current like flags in high wind. Aya's shoulders burned with the effort of holding on. She could feel the pull trying to separate her fingers from the rope, trying to sweep her away into the open Mediterranean where the current ran even faster.
The three minutes crawled past with agonizing slowness. Aya counted her breaths, forcing herself to breathe slowly and deeply. In. Hold. Out. Hold. She watched the computer display tick down: 2:47, 2:46, 2:45.
Karim's eyes behind his mask were wide, showing white around the edges. His air gauge had dropped into the red zone, signaling he had five minutes left, less if he kept breathing this hard. Aya's own gauge showed 600 PSI. Tight, but manageable if nothing else went wrong.
Something felt wrong. 
Aya couldn't articulate what, just a prickling awareness. 
She looked down into the darkness below them, into the empty blue where visibility ended. Empty. Too empty. 
No curious fish who should be investigating their bubbles? 
Then she understood. Something had scared them away. 
The lights appeared from below.
Three beams, cutting through the darkness from the direction of the ruins. Moving fast. Moving with purpose.
Aegis divers. They'd been waiting, watching from a distance, letting Aya and Karim do the work of retrieving the crown lens, then moving in for the attack.
The first diver reached them in seconds, rising from below like a shark. Black wetsuit, full face mask, a pistol leveled at Aya's chest. The second and third flanked them, boxing them against the anchor line.
No warning. No negotiation. The lead diver fired.
The shot went wide by inches, the projectile leaving a trail of bubbles as it passed, the physics all wrong, the trajectory curved by water resistance. But at this range, wrong could still be fatal. 
Aya twisted, kicked hard, releasing the anchor line, putting distance between herself and the shooter as he adjusted aim for a second shot. Her hand went to the knife at her thigh.
Everything became slow and fast simultaneously. The strange time-dilation of underwater combat, where sound traveled wrong, and movement felt like swimming through honey, but death came just as quickly as it did on land.
The second diver went for Karim.
Karim wasn't a fighter. Aya knew it, the diver knew it. But Karim had one advantage. He was holding the anchor line with both hands, and when the diver grabbed for the bag clipped to his BCD, Karim used the extra leverage and swung his legs up and wrapped them around the man's neck.
Not technique. Desperation. But it worked.
The diver's hands went to his throat, trying to break the leg-lock, his mask fogging with exertion. Karim squeezed harder, face contorted behind his own mask, holding on with everything he had while his air gauge dropped toward empty.
Aya didn't have time to help him.
The lead diver was on her, knife out, the blade catching her lamp beam as it slashed toward her throat. Aya blocked with her forearm, and the edge scraped across her dive computer, cracking the display. She countered with an elbow to his mask. The polycarbonate held, but the impact snapped his head back and bought her a second.
She drew her own blade, a ceramic knife weighted for underwater use, the grip textured for wet hands.
They circled each other in the darkness, five meters down and increasing, current trying to sweep them both away. Aya's lungs burned. Her air gauge was dropping faster now, adrenaline making her breathe too hard, burning through reserves she couldn't afford to lose.
The diver feinted left, came right. Aya read it, slipped the thrust, and drove her blade into the gap between his tank and BCD. Not deep, the angle was wrong, but enough to make him flinch, enough to create an opening.
She kicked him in the chest, both feet, the force sending him tumbling backward through the water. His regulator came loose. He grabbed for it, found it, but the distraction cost him.
Aya was already moving, swimming toward the third diver who had Karim pinned against the anchor line, one hand on Karim's regulator, trying to rip it from his mouth while Karim still grappled with the second diver.
She hit the third diver from behind, driving her blade into the gap between his neck and shoulder where the wetsuit ended and the hood began. The ceramic edge found the subclavian artery. She knew it immediately from how the blood came, not seeping but pulsing, hot even through the water, blooming dark in her headlamp beam.
The diver's hands flew to his neck, regulator falling from his mouth as he tried to stem bleeding he couldn't stop. His eyes behind the mask were wide, understanding, terrified.
Aya twisted the blade before pulling it free, making sure. His body went slack, drifting, trailing black clouds that dispersed in the current.
Karim kicked free, but his movements were sluggish. His eyes behind the mask were unfocused. Nitrogen narcosis, low air, panic, all of it combining into the slow drowning that killed experienced divers every year.
Stay with me, Aya thought. Don't you dare die down here.
The lead diver had recovered and was coming at her again. Meanwhile, the second diver was shaking off Karim’s leg-lock, reaching for his own weapon. 
They were running out of time, out of air, out of options.
Then a shape descended from above.
No tank. No BCD. No fins.
Just Amina, free-diving from the surface, her body cutting through the water like a missile plummeting toward them.
The concussion, the depth, the pressure—everything they'd warned her about, all risk factors playing through Aya’s mind.
But Amina wasn't thinking about risk.
She hit the lead diver with a fishing spear she'd grabbed from the boat's dive locker. No time to load it properly in the speargun, no time to aim. Just a three-foot shaft of steel with a barbed tip, and Amina drove it like a javelin into the diver's back.
The point punched through his wetsuit, through the gap between his tank and BCD, finding the space between ribs. The diver jerked, bubbles erupting from his regulator in a scream, body convulsing.
Amina pulled the shaft free, barbs catching along the way, and drove it in again. And again. Brutal, desperate, her lungs already burning from depth and no air, but she couldn't stop because if he recovered, he'd kill them all.
Ten seconds. Fifteen. The diver's movements slowed, then stopped.
Amina released him, pushed off his sinking body, and grabbed the anchor line. Her chest was heaving, cheeks puffed with held breath, eyes wide with the strain of depth and exertion.
Underwater, without air, the fight was a race against Amina’s own lungs.
Go up, Aya signaled desperately. GO UP.
But the second diver was still active, swimming for them.
Aya met him halfway. They collided in a tangle of limbs and bubbles, knife work too close for clean strikes, reduced to elbows and knees and the desperate intimacy of trying to kill someone who was trying to kill you.
Her blade found his shoulder, his found her thigh. A hot line of pain that she couldn't afford tore through Aya’s consciousness. As he struggled to remove the knife she'd planted in his shoulder, she clawed for his mask, ripping it off, and gouged at his eyes while he kicked at her body frantically.
He broke free, started swimming for the surface despite being blinded, bloodied, and drowning on seawater that flooded his sinuses.
But Amina was there, catching him from below. She had the speargun shaft again, wrestled from the lead diver's corpse, and she drove it upward into his abdomen with both hands, planting her legs firmly against his chest for leverage.
The diver folded around the impact, his ascending momentum halted. Amina held him there for three seconds, making sure, then released him and let him sink, trailing blood and bubbles, joining his companions in the dark.
Amina’s face was turning purple, lips pressed tight, eyes bulging with oxygen starvation, consciousness seconds from failing.
Aya grabbed her, pulled her close, and pressed her regulator to Amina's lips, forcing it into her mouth.
One breath. Two. Aya felt the vacuum in her own lungs, felt her vision starting to tunnel, but Amina's eyes were already rolling back. Another three more seconds without air, and she'd pass out and drown.
Three breaths. Four. Amina's eyes focused slightly, her hands coming up to grip Aya's shoulders.
Aya took the regulator back, sucked on nothing. Her tank was empty, reading zero.
She grabbed Amina, shoved her upward, and kicked with everything she had left.
They rose together, too fast, the dive computer screaming warnings that neither of them could hear over the roaring in their ears. Karim was above them, ascending on his own, his movements weak, barely conscious.
Any further safety stop was impossible now. They'd skip it and deal with the consequences, or they'd die down here. Those were the only options.
Aya's gauge hit zero as they passed through eight meters. She took one last breath of nothing, felt her throat close on a vacuum, and kicked harder.
Five meters. Three. One.
They broke through into dawn light, all three of them, gasping and choking and alive. Aya's joints already ached with the warning signs of nitrogen still dissolving in her blood. They'd skipped the stop, and they'd pay for it, but at least they'd pay while breathing. Amina coughed up seawater, her whole body shaking. Karim's face was gray, his breathing ragged, showing the early signs of decompression stress.
Aya spit out her empty regulator, dragging air into lungs that burned like she'd swallowed fire. Her thigh was bleeding freely now, the saltwater making the wound scream, but she could move it, could kick, which meant nothing critical had been severed.
"Go, go!" Deniz was shouting from the boat, his voice cutting through any exhaustion. "Boats inbound! Aegis!"
Aya spun in the water, following his pointing arm. An RIB was approaching fast from the south, maybe five hundred meters away and closing. Twin outboards screamed, throwing up a tail of spray, the bow rising as it planed across the surface at speed.
They'd been waiting. Watching the dive site. Probably had drones up, had been tracking every boat on the water’s position since they arrived.
Deniz already had the engines started, diesel rumbling, exhaust smoking. Amina was at the dive platform, leaning over to grab Aya's hand, hauling her up. Aya collapsed on deck, still in full gear, no time to remove the heavy tank that made every movement awkward. 
Karim came up next, Amina and Leyla working together to haul his weight. He sprawled on deck beside Aya, breathing hard, fins scraping wood as the boat surged forward. 
Deniz didn't wait for him to clear the platform before gunning the throttle, the sudden acceleration almost throwing her back into the water. Aya grabbed a cleat and held on.
"They appeared fifteen minutes ago on radar," Leyla called from the cabin doorway, one hand gripping the frame for balance as the boat accelerated, the other holding binoculars. "Came fast from the north. They were definitely waiting for us."
The gulet wasn't built for speed. It’s twenty-five meters of wood and tradition designed for leisurely cruising, not pursuit. But Deniz's hand was steady on the wheel, his eyes scanning the water with purpose. He pointed left, shouted something in Turkish, and spun the wheel. 
The gulet heeled hard, nearly throwing Aya against the rail.
A reef marker passed fifty meters to their right, warning boats away from submerged rocks. Deniz had steered toward it, not away. 
Karim started to shout a warning, but Leyla grabbed his arm. 
"He knows," she called.
Aya watched the water change colors ahead, dark blue to turquoise to pale green. Deniz was reading depth the way she'd learned to on reef dives, finding safe channels through coral that would tear their hull open.  Dark blue was safe water, ten meters or more. Light blue was getting shallow, five meters. Turquoise, and it was about three meters, risky for most boats. Green meant less than one meter, death for anything with a keel.
Deniz threaded through channels Aya couldn't see, following darkness that indicated safe passage between coral formations, adjusting course based on water color alone. No GPS, no charts, just eyes and memory and decades of fishing these waters before tourists arrived.
He pushed the engines past their normal operating range, the diesel clattering with protest, black smoke pouring from the exhaust. 
The gulet's bow rose as they built speed, the hull beginning to pound against the waves instead of cutting through them smoothly. Every impact jarred through the wooden deck.
Aya watched behind them as the Aegis RIB was gaining. Modern engines, lightweight construction, designed for exactly this kind of pursuit. Twenty knots became twenty-five, the gap closing despite Deniz's best efforts. Aya could see figures in the RIB now. At least three, maybe four, all wearing tactical gear, one pointing ahead at them while speaking into a radio. Maybe other boats.
Deniz spun the wheel hard right, the gulet heeling over with the sudden turn, water washing across the deck. 
They were heading toward a section of coastline where the water showed dark blue, becoming light blue, becoming green, the color changes indicating depth, indicating a reef.
"He's insane," Karim muttered, watching the water ahead. "That's too shallow. We'll ground."
"He knows what he's doing," Leyla said, but her knuckles were white where she gripped the railing.
The RIB was gaining, its modern engines and lightweight construction designed for exactly this, following the gulet's wake with confidence.
Then, Deniz did something unexpected. Instead of running parallel to the reef line, maintaining safe water, he turned directly toward it. The gulet's bow pointed at shallow water, at foam marking where waves broke over submerged coral.
Aya and Amina both braced for impact, Karim following suit.
"Trust me," Deniz called back, seeing the fear on their faces. "RIB draws less water than us. Should be advantage for them. But RIB has propellers, twin outboards mounted below the hull. We have a shaft drive, propeller deep in the keel's protection. Makes difference in rocks."
He'd been watching the tide, Aya realized. Watching how the waves broke, how the foam patterns changed. Reading the reef structure from surface indicators, seeing what lay beneath.
Deniz aimed for a section where the foam broke irregularly, not in consistent lines. Irregular meant a gap in the reef, Aya realized.
The gulet's keel kissed sand, a scraping sound that made Aya's teeth ache. Deniz adjusted the course three degrees starboard. The scraping stopped. They were through, in the channel, threading between coral heads that rose to within a meter of the surface on both sides.
The RIB followed without hesitation.
Chapter 37
“Shit,” Amina yelled.
The boat had followed through the gap and continued gaining on them. Then the RIB hit something submerged at twenty-five knots.
The impact was catastrophic. The rigid hull bucked upward, the bow lifting out of the water. Aya watched as one of the contractors flew forward, hit the windscreen, and collapsed. 
The twin outboards screamed as the props came out of water, cavitating, the engines over-revving. The captain killed them immediately, but momentum carried the RIB forward, broadside to the current now, sliding sideways toward more reef.
The left pontoon scraped over coral. The reinforced material was designed to withstand impacts, but not sustained grinding against razor-sharp coral at speed. 
The pontoon deflated with a hiss that carried across the water, the RIB immediately listing, taking on water through the hull breach, dead in the water.
Deniz threaded through one more narrow section, this one marked only by the way the morning sun glinted off ripples, showing him where the water flowed faster and deeper. 
Finally, they emerged into open water. Behind them, the Aegis RIB was sinking. Its crew was deploying a life raft, one man holding tight onto a radio.
Deniz throttled back finally, the engines returning to normal rumble. He wiped sweat from his face, hands steady despite what he'd just done, despite how close they'd come to grounding, to being disabled just like their pursuers.
"Reef diving since I was ten," he said, as if that explained everything. Perhaps it did.
Aya's heart was still racing, adrenaline making her hands shake. She looked around the deck, taking stock.
Amina had collapsed against the cabin wall, hands pressed to her temples, face contorted. "Stupid," she gasped. "Stupid, stupid—"
"You saved our lives," Aya said, crawling toward her despite her own bleeding leg, the knife wound from the Aegis diver leaving a dark trail across the teak decking.
"I free-dove to fifteen meters with a fresh concussion." Amina's laugh was half-sob. "Everything's spinning. I can't—I can't see straight."
"Just breathe. Slow breaths." Aya gripped her shoulder, feeling Amina trembling beneath her hand.
Karim was worse. He sat against the rail, shivering despite the Mediterranean warmth, his skin taking on a mottled quality that Aya recognized. Decompression symptoms.
"We might need to get him to a hyperbaric chamber," Leyla said, kneeling beside him, checking his pupils.
"We can't," Aya replied. "The moment we show up at any medical facility, Aegis will have us."
"Then we manage it." Leyla's voice was flat, professional. "Keep him hydrated, watch for neuro symptoms, hope the exposure was short enough that his body can handle it."
Aya looked down at her own leg, at the gash that ran from mid-thigh to just above her knee. The Aegis diver's blade had caught her during the underwater melee. Blood welled steadily, mixing with seawater, dripping onto the deck.
"That needs stitches," Leyla said, following her gaze.
"Later. After we're clear."
Leyla disappeared below and returned with the first aid kit, pressing gauze against the wound hard enough to make Aya hiss. "Hold this. Pressure until we can close it properly."
As Leyla worked to stabilize the others, Aya watched Karim's hand move unconsciously to his pocket. Checking. The same gesture she'd seen three times now. The same pocket, the same momentary relief when his fingers found whatever he was carrying.
Another question for later, when they weren't bleeding and shaking and running for their lives.
Deniz navigated into Bodrum harbor at a leisurely pace, just another gulet returning from a morning dive, blending into the traffic of fishing boats, ferries, and tourist vessels just beginning their day. 
They ghosted past a police boat. The officers glanced at them, radio crackling on their belts, but made no move to intercept. Just another day on the water.
By the time they secured the boat back at the marina, the early morning sun was warming the deck. Aya was exhausted, hands shaking slightly from adrenaline crash, the post-crisis weakness that hit when your body realized it didn't need to be in fight-or-flight mode anymore.
But they had done it.
Aya went below to her bag, pulled out the padded case, and opened it carefully. The crown lens sat inside, catching the cabin light and fracturing it into impossible patterns. The key to everything.
"We need to move," Leyla called from the companionway, her phone showing news alerts. "Aegis will call that in. We need to be gone before they arrive."
"Rental villa," Deniz said, already checking coordinates on his phone. "I know a place. Quiet, private, the owner's in Istanbul for the season. You go there, wait for the evening, then leave for Istanbul. I'll handle the authorities; it was my boat. I’ll tell them I saw nothing, rented to tourists who wanted diving, and they left after their dive. Simple."
Twenty minutes later, they split into two taxis, gear and components distributed between them. The drive from Bodrum harbor took them along the coast road, past tourist hotels and beach clubs, climbing into hills where development thinned, where villas spread apart behind walls and gates, where privacy became the luxury people paid for.
The taxi stopped at a wrought iron gate, painted white, half-hidden behind bougainvillea that cascaded in violent magenta blooms. Leyla punched in the access code Deniz had sent. 
The gate swung open on well-oiled hinges, and they followed a paved drive up through terraced landscaping. Olive trees, palms, and a pomegranate tree heavy with fruit.
The villa revealed itself in stages as they climbed: first the upper story with its modern lines and traditional Turkish stone, then the covered terrace with its pergola wrapped in vines, finally the pool and lawn stretching toward the view, with the Mediterranean spreading blue and infinite below, Greek islands visible as dark shapes on the horizon.
Amina paid both drivers, waited until they'd turned around and driven back through the gate before she spoke. "This feels too nice for what we're doing."
"Everything feels too nice for what we're doing," Karim said, looking around the infinity-edged pool that reflected the fresh sky, dropping off to reveal the coast.
They carried their bags inside through French doors that opened onto a living area. Terra cotta floors, cool and smooth.
Leyla checked quickly and found three rooms and two baths, everything clean and ready. Sliding doors opened onto a balcony with the same commanding view, the same sense of being suspended between land and sea. “Looks clear.”
"Sweep?" Amina asked.
"Sweep," Aya confirmed.
Nothing. The villa was clean. Just someone's beautiful home between seasons, waiting for the next guests, indifferent to who those guests were or why they needed privacy and isolation.
Aya stood on the terrace, coming down from the rush of the dive, the escape, being deep underwater with Karim. She looked out at the pool's still water, the lawn's green carpet, the Mediterranean spreading toward horizons she couldn't see. Beautiful. Peaceful. The kind of place where normal people came to relax, to celebrate, to build memories with people they loved.
They were here to prepare for what might be the end of everything, carrying components that could fracture reality, running from people who would kill them to get those components back.
The contrast was almost obscene.
"Clear," Leyla called from inside. "We're alone."
For a long moment, nobody moved. They stood in the beautiful villa, sun-drenched, peaceful, designed for joy, and tried to reconcile it with what they'd just done.
Aya had killed someone underwater, watched the light leave his eyes through the mask. Felt his body go slack under her knife. The Aegis divers had tried to kill them first, but that didn't change the weight settling in her chest. It wasn’t new, but it always felt that way.
Karim stared at his hands. He'd choked a man and held on while the diver fought for his life. That wasn't archaeology. That wasn't research.
Amina pressed her forehead against the cool glass of the window. "We keep getting better at this," she said. "Killing. Fighting. Surviving. Morocco was supposed to be the end, but here we are, drowning people to protect artifacts."
"I need a minute," Karim said quietly, and disappeared without waiting for a response.
"They came for us," Amina called. “We had no choice.”
"They always come for us. And we always have a reason." Aya's reflection in the glass looked haunted. "How many people have died because of these components? How many more before this ends?"
“As many as it takes,” Amina said. “That’s what we committed to.”
Aya turned from the view and walked back inside, limping on her freshly stitched leg. Amina had closed the wound during the drive without an anesthetic, just gritted teeth and Amina's hand to squeeze, but every step still sent fire up her thigh.
Karim was still shivering, his joints aching with what might be the bends or might just be exhaustion. Only time would tell. They'd know within twelve hours if he needed emergency treatment, if the nitrogen bubbles in his blood would dissolve on their own, or start causing permanent damage.
"Sleep," Aya told him. "We'll wake you if anything changes."
He nodded, too exhausted to argue, and disappeared into the nearest bedroom.
Amina took the couch, ice pack pressed to her head, eyes closed against the light that had become unbearably bright. "Wake me if we're dying," she mumbled. "Otherwise, I need to not exist for a while."
"You shouldn't have come down there," Aya said quietly.
"You'd be dead if I hadn't." Amina's eyes stayed closed. "Worth it. Now let me suffer in peace."
That left Aya and Leyla to take stock.
They sat at the villa's dining table, the afternoon sun streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows, the Mediterranean glittering impossibly blue beyond the terrace. It looked like a postcard. It felt like a fever dream.
Aya set the crown lens case at the table's center.
For a long moment, nobody spoke. Exhaustedly, they stared at a padded case that contained something that shouldn't exist, something that had waited four hundred years to be found, something that could change or destroy everything depending on whose hands held it.
Seven pieces. The complete lens system, minus the missing stabilization wafer. Everything Çelebi had scattered, everything Hassan had spent his life protecting, everything Malik needed to tear reality open. All of it sitting on a villa dining table in afternoon sunlight.
Finally, Karim reached out, opened the case.
The crown lens sat in its foam cradle, catching the afternoon sunlight that streamed through the villa's windows. The light fractured as before, bending, shifting, dancing.
Karim picked it up carefully, holding it in both hands, examining every facet, every inscription, every detail of its construction, his face hungry to understand.
"We have everything. It’s finished," Leyla said quietly. "Every component your father scattered across three continents. Every piece Malik's been hunting for years."
"We have it all," Aya agreed. The words felt strange in her mouth. Unreal. After months of running, fighting, losing people. After Hamza's blood sprayed across the cave stone, after the underwater ambush that should have killed them, they'd actually done it.
She looked at the components spread across the table. The glass fragment, still faintly warm. The brass cylinder with its impossible precision. Both calibration rings, one marked with lunar phases, one with planetary orbits. The focusing array they'd pulled from the Cappadocia platform. The crystal heart that hummed at frequencies she felt in her teeth. The assembly charts, four centuries old and still legible. And now the crown lens. The control mechanism, the termination switch, the piece that made everything else dangerous or safe, depending on whose hands held it.
"Without this," Aya said, touching the lens case, "Malik can't achieve controlled activation. Even if he tries with what he has, it'll cascade. Self-defeating. He'd tear himself apart before he accomplished anything."
"So what now?" Leyla asked.
"We leave Turkey. Tonight, if we can manage it. Cross into Bulgaria. Amina and I have contacts there that can help us, and these components disappear. Scatter them again for safety. Different countries, different continents. Hide them in places Aegis will never find, and usher in a new era of guardians. The new Silent Meridian."
"And Malik?"
"Without these, he's finished." Aya leaned back in her chair, feeling the exhaustion settle into her bones. "His alignment window closes in less than two days. After that, he'd have to wait possibly years for another opportunity. By then, we'll have made sure these pieces are unfindable. Buried them so deep that nobody—not Aegis, not any government, not any researcher—will ever assemble them again."
Leyla was quiet for a moment, studying Aya's face. "So we won."
"We won."
The words hung in the air between them. Victory. It should have felt triumphant. Should have felt like vindication for Hamza, for the years of Hassan's life spent protecting these secrets. For Aya’s father.
Instead, it felt hollow. Exhausted. Like reaching the summit of a mountain and discovering the view was just more mountains, stretching endlessly toward horizons she'd never reach.
"You should rest," Leyla said, standing. "You've been running on adrenaline for days. Your body needs to recover, especially with that leg wound."
"What about you?"
"I'll keep watch. Make sure no one followed us, monitor the secure channels for any Aegis chatter." Leyla's smile was tired but genuine. Or practiced enough to look genuine. "Someone has to stay alert. Might as well be the one who didn't almost die underwater today."
Aya studied her face. There was something slightly off in Leyla's expression. Too controlled. Too careful.
"Everything okay?" Aya asked.
"Of course." Leyla's eyes didn't waver. "Why?"
"Just checking." Aya stood, testing her wounded leg. "Wake me in four hours. We'll switch."
"Of course." 
But Leyla's gaze had already shifted to the components on the table. To the crown lens catching the afternoon light. And for just a moment, so brief Aya almost missed it, her face changed. Not relief. Not exhaustion. Hunger.
Then it was gone, replaced by that same tired smile, and Aya told herself she'd imagined it.
Chapter 38
Aya woke to a sense of wrongness.
Her thoughts were thick, sluggish, like pushing through wet concrete. The bedroom was bright. How long had she been asleep? It felt like days, like drowning in black water, consciousness fighting to surface through pharmaceutical fog.
Four hours. Leyla was supposed to wake her after four hours.
But it was already morning, a full glow entering her bedroom. She'd slept far longer than four hours. Much longer.
Aya tried to sit up, but her body didn't respond properly. Her limbs felt disconnected, heavy, like they belonged to someone else. When she finally managed to push herself upright, the room spun violently, and nausea surged up her throat. She gripped the edge of the mattress, breathing hard through her nose, waiting for the vertigo to pass.
She reached for the lamp, her hand moving too slowly, her coordination off. The switch clicked uselessly. Nothing. She tried it twice more before her brain registered. The power was out.
She reached for her phone on the nightstand and pressed the side button. Dead. She'd plugged it in. It should have had hours of battery left.
The wrongness crystallized into fear.
She moved through the eerily still villa on instinct, favoring her good leg, one hand trailing along the wall. The main room was visible in the haze of light streaming in through the windows.
The dining table was bare.
Every case. Every pouch. Every carefully wrapped piece they'd carried across Turkey, fought for, bled for, nearly died for.
Gone.
"No," Aya heard herself gasp, the word escaping before thought could catch it. "No, no, no—"
She lunged for the table, hands sweeping across the surface as if the components might be there and she just couldn't see them, as if this was a trick of the light, a nightmare she'd wake from. Her palms scraped across empty wood. Not even dust remained where the cases had sat hours ago.
"AMINA!" The scream tore from her throat, raw and desperate. "KARIM!"
She ran for the couch where Amina had been sleeping and found her there, slumped sideways, face slack, breathing shallow. Aya grabbed her shoulders and shook hard.
"Amina, wake up. Wake UP!"
Nothing. Amina's head lolled, her eyes stayed closed, her body limp. Aya pressed fingers to her neck and found a pulse, steady but too slow. And there, on the side of her neck, barely visible: a small red mark. 
Needle puncture. Drugged.
"No." Aya's voice cracked, the word coming out strangled. "This isn't… She wouldn't—"
She ran for Karim's room, slammed the door open hard enough to crack the frame. He was in bed where she'd left him, but his breathing was wrong. That same shallow rhythm, that same unnatural stillness. She found the same needle mark on his neck, the same absence behind his closed eyes.
Aya stood in the doorway, chest heaving, her mind racing through possibilities and finding only one that fit. One that she'd been too exhausted, too trusting, too stupid to see coming.
Leyla volunteered to keep watch alone.
Leyla always had the right contacts, the right information, the right resources.
Leyla was the one who pushed for Aya to dive. Who insisted the bloodline authentication wasn't negotiable.
The realization doubled her over, forcing air from her lungs in a sound that was half-gasp, half-sob.
She staggered back into the main room, looking for something, anything—proof that she was wrong, that there was another explanation, that the woman who'd fought beside them, who'd helped Amina through her sacrifice, who'd stitched Aya's leg while she gritted her teeth against the pain.
A phone sat on the kitchen counter. Not Aya's. Not Amina's or Karim's.
Leyla's. Left deliberately. A message, or a confession, or both.
Aya's hands shook so badly that she nearly dropped it twice. The phone was unlocked, showing a single sent message:
“Components secured. En route to Istanbul. Team neutralized but alive. I couldn't do it. Tell Malik I completed the mission. Release Emre.”
She read it once. Twice. A third time, each word burned itself into her brain like a brand.
“Team neutralized but alive. I couldn't do it.”
Couldn't do what? Kill them? Had that been the plan? Had Leyla been supposed to murder them in their sleep, put bullets in their heads while they trusted her to keep watch, and this, leaving them drugged and helpless and hours behind, was her version of mercy?
“Tell Malik I completed the mission.”
Malik. Not MİT. Not Turkish intelligence protecting national interests. Malik. Aegis. The enemy they'd been running from since Istanbul.
Leyla had been theirs from the beginning.
The phone slipped from Aya's fingers, clattering against the tile floor. She barely heard it. Blood roared in her ears, her vision tunneling, rage and grief and humiliation crashing together into something that felt like drowning.
Every moment replayed in brutal clarity.
The underwater ambush. Aegis divers waiting at exactly the right depth, at exactly the right time. Because Leyla had told them. Had probably sent their coordinates while pretending to monitor for threats.
Hamza.
The name hit her like a fist to the chest.
Hamza, taking a sniper's bullet to the skull mid-sentence. Hamza, who'd warned Karim about something being wrong with Leyla, Hamza's last gift of wisdom that they'd received too late. Hamza, who'd seen through her cover when the rest of them were too desperate for help to question good fortune.
And Leyla had ordered his death.
Had called it in, just another loose end to tie up before the endgame.
"Fuck!"
Aya grabbed the nearest object, a ceramic vase filled with decorative branches, and hurled it against the wall. It exploded into fragments, dried flowers scattering like bones, but the destruction wasn't enough, didn't touch the fury building in her chest. She swept her arm across the counter, sending dishes crashing to the floor, crystal shattering, ceramic breaking.
"God damn it!"
She sank to her knees in the debris, hot tears rolling down her face. Her wounded leg strained, but the pain was nothing compared to the hollow devastation.
Everything they'd sacrificed. Everything they'd survived. The balloon escape that should have killed them. The subterranean crawl in Cappadocia. The desperate dive into hostile waters while her wounded side screamed with every kick. Amina risking sacrificing herself, screaming on that obsidian platform while ancient power was ripped from her body. Karim nearly dying from decompression, his skin going gray as nitrogen bubbled in his blood.
All of it, every wound, every loss, every impossible victory, had just been delivered to Malik on a silver platter. And by someone they'd trusted.
Aya didn't know how long she knelt there in the broken glass and ceramic.
Finally, movement from the couch. A groan. The sound of someone fighting through pharmaceutical fog.
"Aya?" Amina's voice was slurred. "What… What time is it? Why does my head feel like—"
She stopped, processing the destruction in the room. The broken glass. The shattered door. Aya on her knees, bleeding, crying.
"What happened?" Amina pushed herself upright, swayed, and grabbed the couch arm. Her voice sharpened with each word as adrenaline burned through the sedative. "Where's Leyla? Where are the components?"
"Gone." The word came out flat. Dead. Like something inside Aya had been cauterized. "She took everything. She was Aegis from the beginning. She drugged us and took everything."
"That's—" Amina stopped. Her face cycled through the same stages Aya had experienced: confusion, denial, the desperate search for an alternative explanation. And then, as the truth landed, rage. Pure, incandescent rage that Aya recognized because she felt it too.
"I'm going to fucking hunt her down and kill her," Amina said quietly. The words weren't hyperbole. They were a promise.
"Get in line."
From the bedroom, a thud of moving furniture. Karim was awake.
Aya forced herself to stand, her wounded leg buckling, catching herself on the counter. Glass bit into her palm. She didn't care.
"Help me with him," she said. "We need to move if we can. She's hours ahead of us."
They found Karim struggling to sit up, his face gray and confused, still fighting through the drug fog. Amina helped him swing his legs over the side of the bed while Aya stood in the doorway, something nagging at the back of her mind.
His hand went to his pocket instinctively. Checking. Always checking.
"Karim." Aya’s voice came out sharper than intended. "What's in your pocket?"
"What?" He blinked at her, uncomprehending.
"Your pocket. You've been checking it for days. Touching it like it's something precious. What are you carrying?"
He stared at her, the fog slowly clearing, understanding dawning.
"She took everything by the way," Aya pressed, the words coming faster now. "Every component. The crown lens, the fragments, the rings, the charts, all of it. So whatever you've been hiding, whatever you took from Cappadocia that you never told anyone about, I need to know right now if we still have a chance."
The color drained from Karim's face. "I knew you’d noticed, but I didn’t know how to tell you. I would have though, eventually. But Leyla never noticed. She didn't search me," he said slowly, the words thick with disbelief. "She must have thought she'd gotten everything from the table. She didn't—"
"What is it, Karim?"
He pulled out the small wafer, intricate and ancient, covered in engravings too fine to make out, with a precisely drilled hole through its center. It was flexible, but weighed at least two kilograms.
Aya stared at it.
"The stabilization array," Karim said. "I took it from the workshop in Cappadocia. During the escape, when everything was in chaos. I wanted to hold it just in case there was another way. To study it and see how this impossible metal was constructed, to see if it came from deep space. I couldn't—I couldn't let it all be lost. I was going to tell you, I swore to Hamza I would, but then things kept happening, and I kept finding reasons to wait and—"
"What does it do?" Aya interrupted, her voice flat with exhaustion.
"Without it, I don’t think the lens can maintain coherence." Karim met her eyes, his expression shifting from guilt to desperate certainty. "Malik can assemble everything else. Every piece Leyla gave him. But if he tries to activate without this component, the system should cascade into catastrophic failure. Uncontrolled dimensional fractures. It'll tear itself apart, and probably him with it."
The words hung in the air.
"So even with everything she took—" Amina started.
"He can't achieve a completely stable activation. Not without this." Karim held up the wafer, brass catching a sunbeam. "This is the one piece that makes the difference between controlled operation and catastrophe."
Aya took the wafer from his hand. It was heavier than it looked, the brass dense and warm. This tiny piece of metal, stolen in a moment of academic selfishness, hidden out of guilt and indecision, and the lure of the historical find.
It was the only thing standing between Malik and success.
"You should have told me," Aya said quietly. “So you and Leyla were both lying to us.”
"I know, yeah, but it’s different."
"Hamza told you to tell the rest of us about it. And you didn't."
"I know." Karim's voice cracked. "I was wrong. I kept rationalizing—thinking I'd give it to you after Bodrum, after we were safe, after I'd decided what to do. But I was lying to myself. I wanted to keep it because I wanted the option to study it. To understand." He laughed, the sound hollow and bitter. "I told myself I was different from Malik. That my motives were pure. But I was doing the same thing he does—deciding that I knew better than everyone else, that my judgment should override centuries of wisdom."
Aya worked to suppress her anger at the secrecy, the broken trust, the months of careful distance between her and Karim that had apparently included this fundamental deception. But she was also holding their only hope in her hand. Because Karim might have accidentally saved them, in his academic selfishness, his scholarly compulsion to preserve.
"We'll talk about this later," she said finally. "Right now, we need to get to Istanbul and find Malik.”
"How?" Amina had made her way to the doorway, leaning heavily against the frame. "We have no car, no components, no plan. Leyla has hours on us."
Aya looked at Leyla's abandoned phone on the floor and dialed the one number that might still answer.
"Omar," she said when the line connected. "We need extraction from Bodrum. ASAP. Leyla was working for Aegis. She took everything, and she's heading to hand it all over to Malik."
A long pause. When Omar spoke, his voice was stripped of its usual humor, hard and focused in a way she'd rarely heard. "How fast can you move?"
"As fast as we have to."
"Give me five minutes. I need to make calls. I'll get back to you."
The line went dead.
Aya stood in the wreckage of the villa, Leyla's phone in her hand, fighting the urge to hurl it against the wall. Five minutes. They had maybe hours before Leyla delivered everything to Malik.
The phone rang.
"Two rental cars are being delivered to your location in forty minutes," Omar said without preamble. "SUVs, clean plates, full tanks. The rental company thinks they're doing a favor for a corporate client. Keys will be left in the ignition."
"Two cars?"
"One more chance, and a little diversion. Seven-hour drive to Istanbul if you push it. You can be there by early evening." His voice shifted, became more personal. "And I'm coming personally."
Aya's chest tightened. "Omar, you don't have to—"
"Yes, I do." His voice was firm, allowing no argument. "I've been running logistics from the background this entire time. Sending you into danger while I stay safe in my networks. Not this time. You need support on the ground in Istanbul. Someone who has resources, who can coordinate in real-time. That's me. I'm already packing."
"Omar—"
"I fucked us, Aya. I should have seen this coming. I've worked on and off with Leyla for years. Trusted her. Vouched for her to you. She played all of us, but I'm the one who brought her into the circle. This is on me." He paused. "I can't undo that. But I can be there when you face Malik. I can provide what you need on the ground. Let me do this. Plus, I’ll beat you there by plane; you’re the one with a long drive ahead of you."
"What about Malik? What do you know?" Aya asked. "Where's he setting up?"
"Galata Tower, just as we suspected. He's been moving equipment there for days, using the renovation as cover. The alignment is tonight at 11:30 PM. Whatever he's planning, that's when it happens. It’s almost 9:30. You have maybe fourteen hours."
Fourteen hours. They had to cross Turkey, infiltrate one of Istanbul's most iconic landmarks, and stop a madman with the complete Astral Lens from tearing holes in reality.
With nothing but a single brass wafer and the rage of three ragged people who'd been betrayed.
"I'll arrange everything I can from the road," Omar continued. "Weapons. Intel on Galata's current security. Building schematics. Aegis movement patterns. By the time you reach Istanbul, I'll have a safe house ready—one Leyla doesn't know about—and everything else you need to hit that tower."
"Thank you," Aya said, and meant it.
"Don't thank me yet. Thank me when we've stopped this, and you're all still breathing." A pause. "Drive safe. See you in Istanbul."
Aya stood in the ruins of the villa's main room, the brass wafer heavy in her palm, Leyla's phone heavy in her pocket.
“Team neutralized but alive. I couldn't do it.”
Leyla had shown them mercy. Had chosen not to kill the people she'd fought beside, even when the mission demanded it.
Aya hoped she'd have the same luxury when they finally caught up with her, but she doubted it.
Chapter 39
The highway north from Bodrum was empty at 4 AM, taillights sparse, darkness absolute beyond the rental car's headlights. 
Leyla drove with both hands locked on the wheel, the bags of components secured in the trunk, wrapped and padded like they contained something more fragile than the future.
Three syringes lay in the passenger footwell, spent. One for each of them. She'd moved through the villa like a ghost, checking pulses after each injection, making sure the doses were right. Too much and they'd never wake up. Too little and they'd fight.
The memory of Aya's face, peaceful in drugged sleep, made her stomach turn.
I couldn't do it.
That's what she'd written. Truth and confession. Malik had been explicit three days ago. Retrieve all components. Eliminate team. No witnesses.
But when she'd stood over Aya with the gun in her hand, safety off, watching Aya's chest rise and fall with drugged breaths—
She couldn't.
Amina on the couch, silver tattoos catching moonlight.
Karim in the bedroom, face gray from decompression, looking young and vulnerable without his glasses.
She'd aimed. Counted down from three. Twice.
Then put the gun away, grabbed the components, and ran.
Emre's face filled her mind. Not the recent video Malik would use as bait, but the first one. Two months ago. His nose was broken, blood crusting his lip, voice cracking. "Please, Leyla. I can't, I can't take much more of this. Just give them what they want. Please, my work doesn’t matter to me anymore."
That had been the moment. When she'd heard him break, heard the man she loved, the smartest person she’d ever met, reduce himself to begging. That's when she'd known there was no choice.
She would burn the world to save him.
If that made her a monster, so be it.
The coast road climbed into the hills, leaving the Mediterranean behind. Dawn was coming, the eastern sky shifting from black to deep purple. By the time the sun rose, she'd be in Istanbul. By tonight, Malik would have everything he needed.
And Emre would be free.
Or you've doomed him along with everyone else. Malik doesn't release hostages. He eliminates loose ends.
She pushed the thought away. Had to believe. Had to hope. The alternative was admitting she'd betrayed people who'd fought beside her for nothing. Betrayed the world for nothing.
Her hands tightened on the wheel until her knuckles went white.
Behind her, somewhere in Bodrum, she knew they were waking up. Finding the empty table. Reading her message on the backup burner phone she’d left behind.
Aya would come for her, no matter what she said. Leyla knew it with absolute certainty. Aya didn't forgive betrayal. She would hunt her, and when they met again—
Leyla’s phone lit up. Unknown number.
She answered on speaker, both hands staying on the wheel.
"You're making good time." Malik's voice, smooth and pleasant, like he was discussing dinner plans.
"I have everything," Leyla said, voice flat. "Crown lens, calibration rings, focusing array, crystal heart. All of it."
"And the team?"
"Alive. Drugged. They'll be hours behind me."
Silence on the line. Long enough that Leyla's pulse started racing, wondering if mercy had just signed Emre's death warrant.
Then: "Interesting choice."
"I completed the mission. You have what you need."
"True." A pause. "Tell me, Leyla, did you leave them alive out of compassion or calculation? Hoping they'll stop me before I can proceed? That Aya Amrani will be your redemption?"
"I left them alive because killing them wasn't originally part of our deal," Leyla said. The lie came smoothly. "You wanted components. I delivered. Plus, they’re so drugged they have no chance of recovering and stopping you."
"Hmm." The sound carried weight. "Well. Either way, it doesn't matter. By the time they reach Istanbul, you’re right, it will be far too late. The alignment window is closing. Even if they come—and they will—they'll arrive to find it finished."
"And Emre?"
"Will be waiting. Galata Tower. You'll deliver the components to the eighth-floor assembly chamber, then collect your fiancé. A clean exchange."
"I want to see him first. Proof of life."
"You'll see him when I say you see him." Malik's voice hardened. "You're not negotiating from strength, Dr. Yilmaz. You have what I want, but I also have what you want. The difference is, once our exchange is made, I will still have the resources to finish you or Emre. Can you say the same?"
Leyla's jaw clenched. "No."
"Then drive safely. We'll see you in a few hours."
The line went dead.
Leyla threw the phone into the passenger seat, her hands shaking.
She'd done it. Crossed every line, burned every bridge, betrayed people who'd treated her like family. And for what? The promise that a man who dealt in murder and manipulation would keep his word?
But what else could she have done?
You could have trusted them, she told herself. Told Aya everything. Worked together to save him.
Too late for different choices.
The highway stretched ahead, carrying her toward Istanbul, toward Malik, toward whatever ending waited in a medieval tower where ancient power and modern ambitions would collide.
Behind her, the sun finally broke the horizon.
Chapter 40
For a moment, they stood there, surrounded by the debris of betrayal and the kindness of strangers. The contrast felt obscene.
"Quick coffee first," Aya said, grabbing a cup. "I need to shake this grogginess from whatever she shot us up with. Then we drive."
She tried to drink but her hands shook, trembling from exhaustion and rage and too many emotions compressed into too small a space. Coffee sloshed over the rim, burning her fingers. She gripped the counter, forced her hands steady, tried again.
Beside her, Karim filled a water bottle and drank without pause, draining it, filling it again. Water ran down his chin. He didn't seem to notice, just kept drinking like his body couldn't get enough.
Amina stood at the window, eating a sandwich mechanically, chewing and swallowing without tasting, staring at nothing. When Aya touched her shoulder, she startled like she'd been hit.
"We need to move," Aya said gently.
"I know." Amina's voice was rough. "Just give me a minute to stop wanting to murder her."
"Take your time. We've got thirteen and a half hours until the alignment."
Amina checked her phone. "It's 10 AM. If we leave in thirty minutes, seven-hour drive... we arrive Istanbul around 5:30. That gives us maybe six hours to prep and infiltrate."
"Not enough time," Aya said.
They loaded two rental cars in the villa's driveway. White Toyota. Silver Nissan.
"I'll take the Toyota with Amina," Aya said. "You take the Nissan. Stay close, don't lose us in traffic."
Karim nodded, keys in hand. His face was drawn, exhausted. "Straight through? No stops?"
"Not unless we have to. We're already behind."
They left Bodrum at 10:27 AM.
Aya started the engine and pushed the Toyota hard, weaving through morning traffic, the speedometer climbing past 140 kph. Behind them, Karim's Nissan struggled to keep pace.
For the first hour, Aya and Amina drove in silence. The highway stretched endlessly ahead, gray asphalt under gray sky.
Behind them, Karim's silver Nissan maintained steady distance. Not too close, not too far.
"Say it," Aya finally said, eyes on the road.
"Say what?"
"Whatever you're thinking. Get it out."
Amina was quiet for a long moment, staring out the passenger window at landscape blurring past. Then:
"We trusted her."
"Yes."
"We fought beside her. Bled with her. Amina's hand moved unconsciously to where the djinn marks used to burn. "I told her things. About my past. About what happened in Morocco. About us. Things I don’t tell anyone."
"I know."
"And she drugged us and left us helpless while she delivered every weapon we've been trying to keep away from Malik straight into his hands."
"Yes."
"And now we're driving north with nothing but rage and a stolen component to stop a man who has everything."
Aya's hands tightened on the wheel. "Yes."
"Good." Amina leaned back, closing her eyes. "Just wanted to make sure we were on the same page."
They drove in silence again after that. Kilometers disappearing, white lines pulsing under their wheels, the sun climbing higher.
The coast gave way to hills, then mountains. Towns blurred past. Traffic thickened as they approached the Marmara region.
Then, north of Denizli, everything stopped.
Brake lights stretched ahead for kilometers. A semi had jackknifed across two lanes. Police lights strobed. Ambulances. The highway had become a parking lot.
"Shit," Aya breathed, checking the time. 3:47 PM. "Shit, shit, shit."
They sat in gridlock for forty-three minutes while the sun crawled toward the horizon and their window narrowed with every passing second.
"What are you going to do when you see her again?" Amina asked finally, eyes still closed.
"I don't know."
"Bullshit. You're Aya Amrani. You always know."
"Then I'll do what needs doing." The words came out harder than intended. "We stop Malik. Everything else is secondary."
"Even her?"
"Even her."
Amina opened her eyes, looked at her. "I don't believe you."
"Neither do I," Aya admitted. "But I'm going to try."
More silence. The kind that wasn't comfortable but wasn't hostile either.
"You know what's funny?" Amina said after another moment passed. "In a really fucked up way?"
"What?"
"I get it. In a really fucked up way." Amina's laugh was bitter. "Not that I'd do what she did. But I understand the impulse. When someone has leverage on the person you love—when it's their life or the mission—your brain just... breaks."
Aya glanced at her. "You walked away from me in Egypt."
"I know." Amina's voice went quiet. "I chose the tactical play over you. And you know I've hated myself for it every day since." She paused. "But that's the thing, I made the 'right' choice. Mission over person. And it destroyed me anyway. Leyla made the opposite choice. Person over mission. And it's destroying everything." Another pause. "There's no good answer when someone you love is the leverage."
"She still chose wrong."
"Yeah. She did." Amina turned to look at her directly. "But I chose wrong too. Just in a different direction. And now I'm here kissing you on a boat deck, knowing it would hurt Karim, knowing it introduces instability in the middle of the most important mission we'll ever have. Knowing it's selfish and messy and destructive." She looked away. "Maybe I haven't learned as much as I thought."
"That's not the same as what Leyla did."
"No. The scale is different. But we're both putting what we want ahead of what's right. She chose Emre over the world. I choose you over... whatever the hell honor or professionalism or basic decency would've been." She laughed again, darker. "We're all just choosing our own flavor of selfish and calling it something else."
Aya didn't have an answer to that. Aya laughed. It came out more bitter than amused, edged with hysteria, but it was still a laugh.
They drove through a small town, its streets quiet in late morning, old women in doorways watching them pass, children kicking a ball in a dusty square.
"I'm sorry," Aya said after the laughter faded. "For putting you in that position. For making this mess."
"You didn't make me do anything. I knew what I was offering. You knew what you were choosing, too. We're adults. It's messy, but it's honest."
"That doesn't make it right."
"No," Amina agreed. "But it makes it real. Which is more than you can say about a lot of things that are supposedly right."
When traffic finally moved again, they made it another hour before Karim's headlights flashed twice. Their signal.
At the next rest area, Karim pulled alongside them. "We need to consolidate," he called through the window. "Two rental cars from Bodrum arriving at the same time? Aegis is watching the highways. We're painting a target."
Aya nodded immediately. "Leave the Nissan. We finish this together."
Karim grabbed his pack from the abandoned rental and climbed into the Toyota's back seat.
"What's wrong?" Aya asked, merging back onto the highway. “I can tell something’s up.”
"I've been thinking about what Hamza said." Karim's voice came from the darkness of the back seat. "About me being like Malik."
"You're not—"
"Let me finish." He leaned forward between the seats. "He was right. Not completely, but enough. I stole that wafer because I couldn't stand the idea of knowledge being destroyed. I lied to you for days because I thought I knew better than centuries of guardians." His voice cracked. "That's exactly Malik's logic."
Aya kept her eyes on the road, weaving through traffic. "The difference between you and Malik isn't the impulse. It's what you do with it. You handed me the wafer. No conditions. You surrendered it when it mattered."
"What happens to it after?" Karim asked quietly. "The wafer. The other components. Do we destroy them? Scatter them? Lock them away?"
"Ask me after we stop Malik."
"And if we don't stop him?"
"Then it won't matter."
Silence filled the car. Aya checked the mirror. Karim's face was barely visible in the dimness, but she could see the exhaustion, the shame.
Beside her, Amina reached back and squeezed his shoulder once. "You're still one of the good ones. Remember that."
After a moment, Karim settled back. "Thanks."
They drove on. Kilometers disappeared, hours ticked down.
Traffic thickened to near-gridlock. Horns. The call to prayer. The eternal chaos.
The sun was setting when they finally hit Istanbul's outer sprawl. The city announced itself in layers. Concrete apartment blocks, industrial zones, then the smell through the vents: exhaust, grilled meat, salt water, millions of people.
Aya checked the time: 5:53 PM.
"We made it," Amina said.
"Barely." Aya's hands ached from gripping the wheel. "We have five and a half hours to save Istanbul."
“I’ll take our odds,” Amina said, before rolling the window down and lighting a cigarette.
Chapter 41
As Amina continued to blow smoke out the window, they navigated through Karaköy's narrow streets, following the GPS coordinates Omar had sent. Stone buildings pressed close, laundry hung from balconies, and cats watched from windowsills.
"There," Amina said, pointing.
A textile warehouse stood at the corner, paint peeling, a faded sign advertising import-export services. And in front, backlit by a streetlamp, a figure waited.
For a moment, Aya thought exhaustion was making her hallucinate.
Then he moved with his distinctive rolling walk, arms spreading wide, and she knew it was real.
"SURPRISE!" Omar's voice boomed across the street, cutting through evening sounds, making heads turn. "In the flesh, okti! In the actual flesh!"
Aya pulled to the curb, killed the engine, and was out of the car before she'd consciously decided to move. She crossed the distance in three strides and crashed into him, arms wrapping tight.
He smelled like cologne and tobacco and safety. Like the carpet shop where this had all started. His arms came around her, solid and real, and she felt release.
"Easy, easy," he murmured, holding her. "I'm here. You're not alone." He pulled back, hands on her shoulders, examining her face. "But, habibti, you look terrible. Absolutely terrible. Mashallah, good thing I'm here to fix you up."
Aya wanted to laugh or cry or both. Settled for something between. "When did you even leave Morocco?"
"As soon as you called, I headed for the airport, and bless Turkish Airlines for having on-board wifi." 
He released her and turned to embrace Amina as she approached. "Amina! Still beautiful, still approaching murder. I can see it in your eyes. The silver suits you, by the way. Much better than what my country did to you."
He held her at arm's length, examining the marks on her arms. "Salah told me what happened in Cappadocia. About the sacrifice. Are you okay?"
"Define okay," Amina said, but she was smiling despite herself. "I'm functional. That counts for something."
"It counts for everything." Omar turned to Karim, who'd hung back slightly, and before Karim could protest, grabbed his face in both hands. "Doctor Archaeologist! Still following Aya into disasters, I see. Someone has to document them for history, yes?"
"Good to see you, Omar," Karim managed, awkward but clearly relieved to see a friendly face.
Omar released him, stepped back, and studied all three of them with eyes that missed nothing. The exhaustion, the barely-contained fury, the way they held themselves.
"Come," he said, his voice gentling. "We have work to do, yes. But first—" He gestured toward the warehouse. "First, you eat. You shower. You breathe. Then we plan how to stop this madness."
He led them through the warehouse's main floor. Real business, Omar explained—bolts of fabric on industrial shelving, a few employees finishing their evening shift, completely legitimate. At the back, an unmarked door led to stairs.
"Check it out, check it out!" Omar called as they climbed. "My impromptu war room. Better than the carpet shop in Marrakech, no?"
The second-floor loft opened before them.
Aya stopped in the doorway, taking it in. Omar had three computer monitors arranged around a table, with sleeping mats arranged around the perimeter. A kitchenette had two bags of groceries on the island, while two duffel bags were stacked in the corner, and a ladder led to a rooftop.
"Omar," Aya breathed. "This is—"
"Magnificent? I know." He moved through the space like a proud homeowner, pointing out features. "Legitimate business cover downstairs. War room up here. Roof access for surveillance. Everything you need to stop an apocalypse in style."
He'd laid out food on the central table. Bread, cheese, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, cold chicken from a rotisserie, and bottles of ayran. The sight of it made Aya realize she was starving.
"Eat first," Omar said. "Then I'll show you the good stuff."
Aya ate standing up because sitting felt like surrender. Her leg throbbed in time with her pulse, and the stitched skin pulled every time she shifted weight. Karim’s hands had stopped shaking, but his jaw was tight, his gaze fixed on nothing as he chewed like it was a task. Amina didn’t startle this time; she just looked empty, cigarette pinned between her fingers like an anchor.
"Come," Omar said. "Before you rest, you need to see this."
He led them up the ladder to the roof.
Istanbul sprawled in every direction. The Golden Horn below, catching city lights. The old city across the water, with its mosques and minarets, silhouetted against the darkening sky. The Bosphorus beyond, carrying ships between continents.
And dominating the skyline, Galata Tower.
That distinctive medieval stone cylinder, topped with its conical roof, rising above the surrounding buildings like a warning. Like a promise. Even at this hour, tiny figures moved on the observation deck—tourists taking photographs, couples watching the city lights come on.
"Three blocks," Omar said, handing Aya binoculars. "Close enough for rapid response and coordination. Far enough for safety, hopefully, if things explode spectacularly."
Aya trained the binoculars on the tower. It looked peaceful. Innocent.
"Just under five hours until alignment," Omar said, checking his watch. "11:30 PM. That's our window."
Aya's stomach dropped. "Five hours to infiltrate, position, and stop him?"
"To infiltrate, yes. To stop him?" Omar's expression hardened. "We make that happen however we can. But first, Salah needs to brief you. Now. While you eat."
"Simple," Amina said dryly.
"Everything's doable with a little planning and magnificent improvisation." Omar grinned. "As you know, I specialize in both."
They descended back into the loft.
"Showers," Omar ordered, pointing. "Five minutes each. You look like hell and smell worse. I'll get Salah on the line."
The showers were brutally fast. Aya let hot water pound her shoulders for three minutes, scrubbing away Bodrum and the road, then forced herself out. No time for absolution. No time for anything but moving forward.
When she emerged in clean clothes Omar had laid out, Salah's face filled the center monitor.
"There she is," Salah said from Marrakech. "Looking significantly less drugged, that’s a bonus for these trying times. How're you feeling?"
"Like I want to kill someone slowly." Aya moved to the table, grabbed bread and cheese, and ate standing up. "What do we know?"
Beside her, Karim emerged from the bathroom, hair still wet, and immediately reached for the food Omar had laid out. Amina was last, coming out in only a towel and mechanically tearing chicken while Salah began his briefing.
"My fine folks, I have more than yesterday, but less than I'd like," Salah said, sharing his screen. Satellite imagery appeared, showing Galata Tower and the surrounding neighborhood. "Malik hasn't left the tower since yesterday afternoon. Floor eight is lit up constantly."
"Components?" Karim asked around a mouthful of bread.
"Can't confirm specifics, but based on intercepted communications, Malik is confident. His Turkish government contact received an encrypted message that reads: 'Alignment activation confirmed for 23:30.'" Salah pulled up more data. "They have personnel in place, but they're keeping a low profile. No tactical gear visible yet."
"And Emre?" Aya asked.
"Exact location unknown. But he's in the tower."
Aya studied the tower schematics Salah displayed. "These plans—"
"Are approximations," Salah finished. "The tower's been modified constantly since 1348. Genoese construction, Ottoman renovations, modern changes. There are definitely spaces not documented." He highlighted sections. "Floor eight is the observation deck. But above that, there's a sealed chamber that appears in Ottoman documents, but nothing modern. That's likely where Malik will attempt activation."
"Entry points?" Aya asked.
"Main entrance is heavily secured. Cameras, guards, metal detectors. You'd be made in thirty seconds." Salah highlighted another area. "Maintenance entrance at rear: fewer cameras, still monitored. They'll expect you there too."
He paused, pulled up older hand-drawn plans. "Then we have option three: the Genoese tunnel system. Connects from Bankalar Caddesi area through Byzantine cisterns to the tower foundation. Original construction dates to the 1300s. Whether it's still navigable, whether it actually reaches the tower, whether it's been sealed—I can't verify any of that from here."
"Theoretical," Amina said. "Our favorite word."
"Better than impossible," Salah countered. "But I won't sugarcoat it. Once you're underground, you're on your own. My maps end at the cistern level. After that, you're navigating passages that I don’t believe have been mapped in centuries."
“And if not, the backup plan is to go in guns blazing at the rear entrance?” Amina asked.
Salah grimaced. “Just remember, my tech’s good, and we’ve gotten the drop on Aegis before. But theirs is better, and they’re always one step ahead of us. We have to hope they’re getting arrogant or missed something, like in the Sahara.”
Aya nodded. “Malik’s more calculating, but he has a bigger ego than Léglise. That’s a strong advantage for us.”
"Okay, so the tower was originally a military installation," Karim said, studying the plans. "Defensive position controlling the Golden Horn. Hidden access for siege scenarios would make tactical sense. But modern renovations almost certainly sealed those passages."
“We have to hope they didn’t,” Aya said. “Or that we can break through.”
Omar's grin widened. "Funny you should mention Bankalar Caddesi. I happen to have a very legitimate import-export business contact with a very convenient basement. The previous owner didn't know it was connected to abandoned tunnels. A few strategic walls removed, and voilà. Private access to Istanbul's underground. If we’re lucky, it should link up."
"How did you—" Aya started.
"Trade secrets, okti." Omar's grin was pure mischief. "Let's just say in my past, I was exceptionally good at finding places to hide merchandise. And at negotiating leases with landlords who don't ask questions."
"That’s wicked, Omar," Salah said, shaking his head with admiration. "You beautiful bastard. All right, I'll be monitoring all channels once you're inside. Any changes—reinforcements, timeline shifts, Malik moving equipment that I can see—you'll know immediately."
"Thanks, Salah," she said. "We'll check in once we're inside."
"Inshallah, you all come back up with titanic struggle long behind us," Salah said. "And when you do, the first round of drinks is on me. Marrakech or Istanbul, your choice. Just survive, yeah?"
The screen went dark.
"Time until we need to move?" Aya asked Omar.
Omar checked his watch. "It's 6:47 PM. I'd say you enter those tunnels by 7:00. That gives you four and a half hours to navigate, breach, and position before alignment."
"Thirteen minutes," Karim said quietly. "We have thirteen minutes to gear up and go."
The room fell silent with the weight of it settling over them.
"Then let's move," Aya said.
Omar moved to his tactical cache. "Gear time, ladies and gentleman. We outfit you properly, then you go save Istanbul."
Aya stood, her wounded leg protesting. The knife wound from the underwater fight pulled with every movement, reminding her of Bodrum, of Leyla's betrayal, of everything that had led them here.
He distributed equipment with practiced efficiency. Encrypted earpieces. Glock 19s with suppressors. Magazines. Smoke grenades. Compact breaching charges. Climbing gear. Water. Energy bars. Tools.
"No body armor," Omar said. "You need to move fast, move quiet."
Aya loaded her magazines, checking each round by feel, muscle memory taking over. Beside her, Karim handled his weapon carefully, like he was afraid it might bite. Amina field-stripped hers, checking everything, reassembling in seconds.
"The wafer," Aya said, handing it to Karim. Inside, the brass stabilization array sat cushioned in foam.
He lifted it carefully, examined it in the light. "This is our only advantage. Malik thinks he has everything. But without this—"
"The system cascades," Aya finished. "And we make sure we're positioned to survive when it does."
"Positioned where, exactly?" Amina asked. "If the discharge happens, if dimensional fractures start opening, where's safe?"
Karim studied the schematics on Omar's screen. "Nowhere in the tower's completely safe. But Hassan's notes mentioned that the lens system requires line-of-sight to the alignment. The assembly chamber will be positioned with a clear view of the sky. That's ground zero." He traced a path with his finger. "We need to be at least two floors below, ideally with stone walls between us and the chamber. Let the medieval architecture absorb the worst of it."
"So we infiltrate," Aya said, thinking it through. "Look for a chance to stop them by force—kill Malik, seize the components. If we can't, we observe from a distance. Let Malik think he's winning. And when he attempts activation—"
"We watch him fail," Amina interrupted. "Watch it start to cascade. Then we step in with the shut-off valve before it destroys Istanbul."
"Exactly."
"And Leyla?" Omar asked carefully.
The question hung in the air. The one everyone kept dancing around.
"She made her choice," Aya said finally. "She's standing with him now. If she's in that chamber when it happens—"
"She knew the risks," Amina said, her voice hard. "Whatever happens to her is her own doing. We shouldn't think twice about ending her if we have to."
"She also couldn't kill us," Karim said quietly. "She showed mercy when she didn't have to."
"Mercy doesn't absolve betrayal," Aya said. "It just makes it more complicated."
They sat with that truth for a moment. Then Omar cleared his throat.
"Time check. 6:58 PM. You need to move. Now."
Aya secured the brass component in its waterproof pouch, tucked it inside her tactical vest, where it pressed against her ribs.
"If something happens to me," she said, looking at Amina and Karim, "one of you gets this. Make sure it stays away from Malik."
"Nothing's going to happen to you," Amina said.
"But if it does—"
"If it does," Amina promised, "I'll make sure Malik fails and dies the most miserable, pitiful death we can inflict."
Omar checked his watch. "6:58 PM. Time to move."
He led them down the stairs, through the warehouse, out into Istanbul's night. The contrast was jarring, from tactical silence to the chaos of the city.
They moved through Karaköy like ghosts, Omar's distinctive walk purposeful, none of his usual theatrical energy. This was Omar the smuggler, the man who'd navigated unseen for decades.
They emerged onto Bankalar Caddesi. A warehouse district, quieter than the tourist areas. Omar stopped at a nondescript building, fumbled with keys.
"This is it," he said. "The tunnels start in the basement. From there, you're on your own."
The door opened. Darkness beyond. The smell of dust and damp and centuries.
Omar turned to face them. For a moment, he didn't speak, just looked at each of them in turn.
"I'll monitor from the loft," he finally said. "Salah will feed me updates. If anything changes, you'll know immediately. And when you come back up—" His voice caught slightly. "—when, not if—I'll have hot tea waiting."
Aya embraced him first. He held her tight.
"You come back," he said into her ear. "You hear me?"
"I will."
He released her, turned to Amina. "Keep her alive. Keep each other alive.  I've grown surprisingly fond of you all, and I'd hate to have to find new friends."
"We're not dying today," Amina said.
Finally, Karim. Omar grabbed his face in both hands.
"You're a good man," Omar said. "Trust yourself. Trust your team. Come back so I can truly corrupt you."
Karim managed a small laugh. "I'll do my best."
Omar gestured toward the darkness. "Go forth. Stop this madness."
Aya entered and activated her headlamp. The beam revealed concrete stairs descending into the earth.
"Comms check," she said into her mic.
"Reading you clear," Omar's voice crackled in her earpiece. "Salah confirms. You're live."
"Copy. We're moving."
They descended. Aya leading, Amina in the middle, Karim bringing up the rear.
The temperature dropped with each step. The air grew damp, cool, carrying the mineral smell of deep earth. The outside world faded until it was just their breathing and their footsteps and the steady drip of water somewhere ahead.
At the bottom, the Byzantine cistern stretched before them, vast enough that her narrow beam couldn't reach the far wall. The brick ceiling held up by hundreds of columns, each one different, like they were scavenged from Roman temples and Greek buildings, and structures Aya couldn’t identify. Corinthian capitals with acanthus leaves. Ionic scrollwork. Plain Doric simplicity.
Shallow water covered the floor, reflecting their headlamp beams like a dark mirror.
"Beautiful," Karim breathed.
"It's also massive," Amina said. "How do we find the right path?"
"Follow the lights, smugglers have been using these tunnels," Aya said, spotting faint reflective strips along what looked like a maintained route.
"This is it," Aya said. "Omar, we might be going dark for a bit. The passages might block the signal."
"Understood. Call when you can. And Aya?" A pause. "You’ve got this."
They moved forward into the water, into the darkness, into the ancient passages that would, if they were lucky, lead them to Galata Tower's foundation.
Time collapsed toward 11:30 PM, toward whatever ending had been written in the stars four centuries ago when Çelebi first understood what he'd created and chose to create a secret society to hide it from the world.
Chapter 42
Leyla's hands shook as she positioned the calibration ring, aligning the lunar-phase markings with the indicators Malik had etched into the mounting bracket. The brass was cool under her fingers.
"Steady," Malik said from across the chamber. He was working on the focusing array, his movements precise and assured. “If the alignment is off by even a degree, the entire flow cascades.” He didn’t look up as he said it, just thumbed a knurled micro-adjuster on the focusing array. A barely audible tick. Another. The brass ring shifted by a fraction.
"I know." Her voice came out sharp. The ring clicked into place with a sound that felt too final.
The chamber Malik had chosen was perfect. The sealed space was between the observation deck and the conical roof, eight-sided, reflecting Çelebi's obsession with astronomical symbolry. Windows on each wall were well-positioned to track planetary movements, and in the center, the assembly platform where components now gathered like pieces of a puzzle.
Crown lens. Crystal heart. Brass cylinder. Both calibration rings. The focusing array. Everything Aya's team had fought for, bled for, nearly died for.
Everything Leyla had stolen while they slept, drugged and helpless.
"Second ring," Malik said, not looking up. "Planetary orbit. Three o'clock position."
Leyla retrieved it from the case. She hadn't eaten since the previous day. Hadn't slept except in brief, nightmare-plagued intervals where she saw Aya's face peaceful in drugged sleep and her own hand holding the gun she couldn't force herself to use.
I couldn't do it.
The words from her message haunted her. Truth and confession and weakness all compressed into four words.
She positioned the second ring, aligned the planetary markings. Click. Another piece of the machine was assembled. Another step toward whatever Malik believed would happen at 11:30 PM when the planets aligned and he attempted to open doors Hassan had died trying to keep closed.
"Where is he?" Leyla asked without planning to. "Emre. You said he'd be here. That I could see him once I delivered everything."
Malik finally looked up. His face was calm, the expression of a teacher explaining something to a slow student. "And you will. After activation. After we've confirmed success. Then you collect your fiancé and go wherever you want, free. Stay in Turkey, travel Europe, relax on a beach in the Maldives. I'll provide papers, money, and a fresh start. You have my word."
"Your word." The laugh escaped before she could stop it. "Yeah, the word of a man who kidnaps and tortures to get what he wants."
"I merely apply appropriate leverage." Malik returned to his work. "And I haven't tortured Emre. He's been quite cooperative since you started delivering results."
The casual way he said it made her want to scream. Or cry. Or grab one of the brass components and beat him with it until he stopped moving.
But she couldn't. Because he had Emre. Because she'd come too far.
"They're coming," she said quietly. "You know that. Aya won't let this go. She'll find a way inside."
"Let her come." Malik positioned the crystal heart in its cradle, checked alignment. “By the time she arrives, it will be too late.” He seated the crystal heart, then leaned in and adjusted its cradle with two fingers, nudging it and easing it back until the heart stopped trembling and the faint blue thread in the channel ran straight instead of wavering. 
“The activation window is only a few hours away,” he continued. “Even if she finds a way in, she'll arrive to find it finished. And then she'll have a choice: accept what I've accomplished or die like her father." He smiled. "I'm hoping she chooses acceptance. She has potential in our organization and a place at the table when we accomplish great things for humanity. Her father certainly did, before fear consumed him."
"Hassan was right to be afraid," Leyla said. "This power, it's not meant to be used."
"Says who? Çelebi, who lived in an age of superstition? The Silent Meridian, who hoarded knowledge rather than advancing human understanding?" Malik's voice rose with passion. "We stand at a threshold, Leyla.” 
He slid a thin gauge between two brass teeth, felt the drag, and tightened one set screw by a quarter turn. The gap vanished. The machine obeyed. Malik’s mouth curved as if the world should be as compliant as metal. 
“Climate collapse, resource depletion, geopolitical chaos. Humanity needs an evolutionary leap, not incremental progress. This lens doesn't destroy. It opens. It allows us to access energy states beyond our current understanding. To see things as they truly are rather than through the limited aperture of conventional perception."
"And if you're wrong?" Leyla asked. "If Hassan was right, that partial assembly creates uncontrolled fractures? If activation tears holes in reality that can't be closed?"
"Then we'll have learned something, and Aegis will continue its march toward progress." Malik turned to face her fully. "But I'm not wrong. I have Hassan's research, Çelebi's calculations, and components assembled according to precise specifications. The system will work because I've ensured every variable is controlled."
"Except the one variable you can't control," Leyla said quietly. "The one where this all goes catastrophically wrong."
"Faith, Leyla. Sometimes we must have faith in human ingenuity and a belief in powers we can’t comprehend in this world." He checked his watch. "Go. Rest. You've been working for hours. I need you sharp for tonight, not dead on your feet. There's a break room on floor six with a cot, basic facilities. Sleep for an hour. I'll call you when I need you."
Leyla wanted to argue, but exhaustion was winning. Her eyes burned. Her hands ached. Her mind felt like fog.
"And Emre?"
"Is fine. Sleeping, probably. Like you should be." Malik's expression softened slightly. "I keep my promises, Leyla. You delivered everything I needed. When this is over, when I've proven what's possible, you'll have him back. Both of you free and clear, far away from here. That's what you want, isn't it? To disappear together? To pretend none of this happened?"
"Yes," she whispered.
"Then trust me. A little more time. Then it's over, and you can begin again."
Leyla left the chamber, descended the spiral stairs to floor six, and found the break room Malik had mentioned. Cot with a thin mattress. Sink with rust stains. A window where the sun climbed higher over a city that had no idea what was coming.
She lay down without removing her shoes. Closed her eyes. And tried not to see Aya's face, tried not to hear Amina's laugh, tried not to remember Karim explaining Byzantine architecture like they had all the time in the world.
Tried not to calculate how many people might die if Malik was wrong.
Tried to believe that saving one person she loved was worth the risk of destroying everything.
But exhaustion was merciful. Within minutes, she was asleep, dreamless and deep, while above her, Malik continued assembly, and below her, Istanbul lived its oblivious afternoon, and three people descended into tunnels carrying the piece that could make his grand vision collapse into catastrophe.
Chapter 43
The passage beyond the cistern closed around them like a fist tightening. Their headlamps didn’t push the dark back so much as carve narrow cones into it, the edges trembling with dust. Each breath came damp and metallic, as if the stone was stealing oxygen a sip at a time. 
Behind Aya, Amina's breathing echoed in the confined space, steady but close. The passages had been built six centuries prior for moving soldiers and supplies unseen. The walls pinched her shoulders when she inhaled, then let go when she exhaled, as if the tunnel was timing itself to her lungs.
"Omar, comms check?"
Static. Then his voice crackled through, distorted but present. "Still here, habibti. Signal's weak but holding."
"Copy. How long until we lose you completely?"
"Hard to say. Medieval stone plays hell with radio waves. Could be another hundred meters, could be ten. If you lose me, don't panic. I should be able to pick you up again when you're closer to the tower foundation."
"Understood."
Aya counted steps. Forty-seven. Sixty-two. Ninety-one.
At one hundred and fifteen, the passage leveled out and widened slightly. Relief flooded through her. She could breathe without feeling the walls press against her ribs.
Then her headlamp caught something carved into the wall.
She stopped, raised her hand. Behind her, Amina and Karim halted immediately.
The symbol was small. An eight-pointed star within a circle, the rays extending just beyond the border. Exactly matching the designs from Cappadocia, from the cemetery, from every Silent Meridian site they'd uncovered.
"Çelebi's people," Karim whispered, moving beside her. "This is the right path."
"Or it's a very old dead end," Amina said from behind them.
"Only one way to find out." Aya touched the carving, her gloved fingers tracing the channels worn deep. "Keep moving."
Aya checked her watch. 7:32 PM. Four hours until alignment, to breach a fortified tower, and stop Malik.
They were already behind schedule.
The tunnel branched twice over the next twenty minutes. Each time, they found the eight-pointed star marking the correct path. Left at the first junction. Right at the second. The Silent Meridian's breadcrumb trail, four hundred years old and still legible.
At the third branch, Aya drew up quick, and Amina slammed into her from behind.
“Shit.”
The passage ahead was sealed, deliberately bricked up. Someone had wanted to make sure this route stayed closed.
“Of course,” Amina said with a sigh.
"Omar?" Aya tried her mic. Static greeted her. "Omar, if you can hear me, we've got a sealed section. We'll have to breach."
Nothing but white noise in response.
Karim moved forward, examining the brickwork with his headlamp. His hands traced the mortar lines, testing for weakness. "This is probably sixteenth century, roughly the same era as Çelebi. They sealed it after hiding the lens components."
"Can we get through?" Aya asked.
"We brought explosives for this." Karim pulled a compact breaching charge from his pack. "But in a confined space like this, we need to be careful. The blast wave has nowhere to go. And there’s no telling who will hear it."
“Or if the whole damned thing will cave in,” Amina added.
"Okay, we’ll back up fifty meters and pray the ceiling doesn't collapse on us,” Aya said. “We have no choice now.”
Karim worked quickly, placing the small explosive device against the mortar at strategic weak points. But his hands shook as he ran the detonation wire back to their position.
"First time placing charges in a confined medieval tunnel," he muttered. "Let me just... there."
"Ready?" Aya asked.
"No," Amina said. "Do it anyway."
The detonation didn't work.
Karim stared at the trigger in his hand. "That should have—"
"Bad connection," Aya said, moving forward. "We need to re-place the charge."
They worked in silence for another fifteen minutes, sweat dripping despite the cool air, every second ticking away. Finally, Karim had the charge properly seated.
"Now?" he asked.
"Now."
This time, the explosion was catastrophic in the confined space. The pressure wave slammed into Aya's chest like a hammer, pushing her back hard against the tunnel wall. Her ears rang with sharp, painful clarity.
The dust rolled toward them in a slow wave, crawling into mouths and noses and the seams of their gloves. Aya blinked, and the beam of her headlamp turned into a milky column with no depth, like the tunnel had erased distance. 
When the air cleared enough to see, the brick wall had a hole punched through it. Jagged-edged, barely wide enough for a person, but open.
Aya checked her watch through the dust. 8:16 PM. Three hours and fourteen minutes.
"That'll do," Amina said, coughing. "Let's move."
They squeezed through one at a time, and beyond the breach, the tunnel changed.
The walls were older here. Not cut stone but a natural cave, smoothed by water. The floor sloped downward, and every surface was damp.
And on the wall were more markers. Not just the eight-pointed star but other writing.
Karim pulled out his phone. "'Beyond lies the threshold,'" he translated, reading by headlamp. "'Where earth meets artifice, where knowledge sleeps.'"
"Poetic," Amina said. "Does it mention how far to the tower?"
"No. Just that we're close."
They pushed deeper. Stalactites hung from the ceiling like stone teeth. Water dripped constantly, the sound echoing, making it impossible to hear anything else. Every shadow could hide a threat or nothing at all.
Aya's headlamp caught movement ahead.
She raised her fist. Behind her, Amina and Karim froze, weapons appearing in their hands.
The movement came again.
A scatter of bodies broke the dark. Slick backs, claws on stone, eyes catching light and vanishing. The squeals ricocheted, multiplying in the chamber until it sounded like footsteps.
Aya exhaled through her teeth. “Rats.”
"I hate rats," Karim muttered.
"I much prefer them to Aegis," Amina said.
They continued forward, nerves stretched tight, every sound amplified by paranoia and darkness. Then the passage opened abruptly into a chamber.
Aya swept her headlamp across the space and stopped breathing.
They'd found it. The Silent Meridian's final waypoint.
In the center stood a carved stone table, waist-high, its top surface marked with channels that formed the now-familiar eight-pointed star. And on that pedestal sat something small and wrapped in deteriorated cloth.
Karim moved toward it.
"Wait," Aya said, grabbing his arm. "Could be trapped."
"It's been here for centuries. Surely any trap would have degraded by now."
"Or it's exactly as deadly as it was four hundred years ago."
But Karim was already reaching for the object. He unwrapped the cloth carefully, revealing what lay beneath.
A small brass piece covered in familiar etchings.
"Is this another component?" Karim asked.
Aya shrugged. "We’re seriously flying blind. Take it. We need to keep moving."
Karim pulled out his phone, raising it to photograph the inscriptions.
“No,” Aya said, grabbing his wrist in disbelief. “We don’t have time.”
“But these markings—”
“Will still be here later. If we survive.”
She snapped a quick photo herself, one flashless frame, then wrapped the disc back in the cloth and pocketed it. “Move. Now.”
Karim hesitated a fraction, then nodded. “Done. Let’s go.”
Karim looked at the chamber one last time. Then he turned and followed.
Aya checked her watch. 8:48 PM. Two hours and forty-two minutes.
The passage beyond the chamber climbed steeply, carved stairs ascending through bedrock. Aya's legs burned with each step, her wounded side sending sharp complaints that she ignored.
They climbed for twenty minutes before Amina stopped.
"Wait. This doesn't match the schematics." She pointed at a junction ahead. "We should've hit a straight climb. This branches."
Aya swept her headlamp over both passages. Neither showed the eight-pointed star. "Shit. We took a wrong turn back at the chamber."
They backtracked, boots splashing through water that had grown deeper, retraced their steps to the waypoint chamber. Found the passage they'd missed—narrower, easier to overlook in their rush.
"Here," Karim said, spotting a faint star carved near the floor.
Fifteen minutes wasted. Fifteen minutes they didn't have.
9:11 PM. Two hours and nineteen minutes.
The stairs wound upward in a tight spiral, making Aya dizzy, making the walls feel like they were closing in.
Then her headlamp again caught something ahead that made her stop short.
Brick. Modern brick. Blocking the passage completely.
"Another seal," Karim said, moving forward to examine it. His hands traced the work, feeling for weak points. "They sealed the passage from above when they renovated the tower."
"Can you breach it?"
"Yes. But we're directly under the tower foundation now. The explosion will be heard topside."
"How long until Aegis responds?"
"Minutes. Maybe less if they're already on alert for these tunnels."
Aya tried her comm unit. "Omar? Omar, if you're receiving, we're breaching the tower foundation in ninety seconds. Confirm if you copy."
Static. Then, faint beneath the interference: "...copy...breach...monitoring...sixty seconds..."
His voice cut out completely.
"Do it," Aya said to Karim. "Fast and loud. We're out of time for subtle."
Karim placed the breaching charge against the brick, using twice the explosive they'd used earlier. They retreated down the stairs, took cover, and he triggered the detonation.
The explosion shook the passage. Dust filled the air. When it cleared, the wall was barely cracked.
"Fuck," Amina breathed.
"The foundation's reinforced," Karim said, examining the damage. "Modern concrete behind the old brick. We need more charges, but we’re getting close."
They placed two more devices, using most of their remaining explosives. Retreated again. Waited.
This time, the blast was massive. The shockwave punched the air out of Aya’s lungs. The ceiling answered with a deep, settling groan, and dust sifted down in a fine, deliberate rain, as if the tower was deciding whether to keep them. 
Then the groaning stopped. The dust began settling.
The wall had a ragged hole punched through it. Large enough to climb through, but only just.
Aya checked her watch. 9:43 PM. One hour and forty-seven minutes.
"Move," she ordered.
She moved forward through the haze, weapon raised, ready for Aegis to be waiting on the other side.
The breach opened into darkness.
Aya climbed through, boots finding purchase on rubble, emerging into a space that felt different. The air moved here. Temperature shifted. 
She was inside the tower.
The foundation breach had eaten their breaching charges, but they still had shaped charges left: directional, precise, meant to punch through stone, not bring a structure down.
Her headlamp revealed a maintenance corridor, narrow and utilitarian. Electrical conduits ran along the ceiling. Water pipes. Service access.
Behind her, Amina and Karim climbed through the breach.
"We're in," Aya whispered into her mic. "Omar, do you copy?"
His voice crackled back immediately, stronger now. "Copy! You're inside, probably the ground floor maintenance level, northwest corner. I have building schematics displayed. You should be able to reach the service stairs, about twenty meters to your right, through the door at the corridor's end."
"Aegis positions?"
"Copy. Moving to stairs."
“Time check. 9:47 PM,” Amina called out. “One hour and forty-three minutes until 11:30.”
At the corridor's end, a service door stood slightly ajar. Beyond it, Aya could hear voices.
She pressed against the wall beside the door, signaling Amina and Karim to hold position. Carefully, she risked a glance through the gap.
The service stairwell beyond was empty. But voices echoed from above, at least two, maybe more.
"Clear for now," she whispered into her mic. "But they're close. Very close."
Aya eased the door open and slipped through.
They climbed lightly, ensuring their wet boots made almost no sound on concrete stairs. Each landing brought them higher into the tower's interior, closer to whatever Malik was building on floor eight.
At the second-floor landing, the voices stopped them, descending. 
Their conversation sounded casual, Aya guessing a shift change or equipment check, impossible to be sure. But they were coming down, and there was nowhere to hide.
Aya raised her weapon. Beside her, Amina did the same. 
Three meters away. Two meters. Close enough to hear their breathing now.
The first operative rounded the landing corner.
Amina fired twice. Suppressed shots that sounded like coughs in the enclosed stairwell. The first man's chest bloomed red. He collapsed backward, taking his partner down with him.
The second operative shouted, reaching for his weapon.
Amina's shot caught him in the throat. He gurgled, trying to scream, hands going to his neck. She fired again, and the gurgling stopped.
Silence fell, broken only by blood dripping onto concrete.
"Drag them," Aya ordered. "Side corridor. We need to hide the bodies."
They worked fast, pulling both corpses into a maintenance closet, closing the door on dead eyes and spreading blood. It wouldn't fool anyone who actually looked, but it might buy them minutes.
"Omar?" Aya whispered into her mic as they continued climbing.
"Here. What happened?"
"Two down. We're compromised if anyone finds them."
"Then don't let anyone find them. You're four floors below target."
They ascended faster, caution balanced against time. Each landing brought them higher, brought the thrumming in the stone stronger. The tower itself seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for whatever was unleashed at 11:30.
At the sixth-floor landing, Aya caught something through a small window in the stairwell door. She pressed her face to the glass, looking into the floor beyond, and saw him.
Emre.
He sat in what looked like a break room, shoulders slumped, hands wrapped around a cup of tea he wasn't drinking. He looked smaller than in Leyla's photographs. Thinner. Broken in ways that had nothing to do with visible injuries.
But alive.
"Omar," Aya whispered. "We have visual on Emre. Floor six, break room. He's alive."
"Copy. Continue to floor eight. Emre is leverage but not the mission."
"Understood."
Aya pulled away from the window and forced herself to keep climbing. Behind her, she felt Amina's hand briefly touch her shoulder.
They reached the seventh-floor landing at 10:44 PM.
Aya checked her watch. Forty-six minutes until alignment.
Through the stairwell walls, she could hear machinery humming, along with a deep vibration that made her teeth ache. A sound that didn't belong in the physical world.
"He's already starting," Karim whispered, pressing his hand against the wall. "Preliminary activation. Aligning the components."
"Then we're out of time for careful planning," Amina said.
"Omar," Aya whispered. "Floor seven. We’re in position here, ready to plant charges in the ceiling and wait for the action to begin."
"Copy," Omar said in her ear.
Aya eased the stairwell door open, checking the corridor beyond. Empty. Storage rooms and maintenance access, exactly as the schematics had shown. They slipped through, moving directly below where Malik worked.
Karim began unpacking demolition equipment, laying out shaped charges designed to breach upward through medieval stone. Amina positioned herself at the corridor entrance, weapon raised, watching for patrols.
"We have forty-five minutes before full activation," Aya said. "Maybe less if he accelerates the sequence. Karim, how fast can you place those charges?"
"Ten minutes if we're lucky. Fifteen if the ceiling's reinforced."
"Do it. As fast as you can. Amina, watch the corridor. Omar—"
"Still here," his voice crackled. "I'm monitoring everything. You're cutting this close, habibti."
"Story of my life," Aya said.
She secured the brass wafer in its pouch one more time, felt its weight against her ribs. Their one advantage. Their only chance if the breach failed.
Above them, the tower thrummed with building energy, stone resonating with something ancient and terrible and alien.
"I'll check the breach point," Karim said, moving down the corridor with his equipment. "Map the ceiling structure, find the weakest points. Give me five minutes."
His footsteps faded, leaving Aya and Amina alone in the storage room.
Aya slid down the wall, sitting on the cold concrete floor, her wounded leg throbbing after hours of climbing. Through the walls, the terrible thrumming continued.
Amina sat beside her, close enough that their shoulders touched.
"You ready?" Amina asked quietly.
"No," Aya admitted. "But I don't think ready exists for this."
"Probably not." Amina's hand found hers in the darkness, squeezed once. "For what it's worth—I'm glad I'm here. Glad I'm doing this with you. Even if it ends badly."
"It won't end badly."
"But if it does—" Amina turned to look at her directly, their faces barely visible in the dim emergency lighting. "—I love you."
Aya squeezed her hand back, but couldn't find words that felt adequate. Her throat closed. "Amina, I—"
"I know. First, we need to stop the apocalypse," Amina replied in monotone. "Then we worry about our messy lives. Priorities."
Aya smiled. "Priorities."
They sat in silence for another moment, shoulders pressed together, hands clasped.
Then Karim's footsteps echoed back down the corridor.
They stood, professional distance restored, weapons checked, ready.
But Aya's hand still felt warm where Amina had held it.
They had forty-three minutes to stop Malik, or forty-three minutes to have a front-row seat to a global catastrophe.
Chapter 44
Karim returned from his reconnaissance, tools in hand.
"Found the optimal breach points," he said, kneeling beside their gear. "Ceiling looks reinforced in places, but there are structural weaknesses we can exploit."
“Okay, let’s go.”
Aya carried the explosives while Amina held their perimeter, dual-wielded handguns locked on both sources of entry.
Back in position, Karim began placing charges, positioning each at the weak points he'd identified. Aya watched him connect detonation wire between charges, creating a circuit that would blow simultaneously.
"Almost done," Karim muttered. "When you trigger this, we'll have maybe three seconds before the ceiling comes down. We go through fast, or we don't go through at all."
"Fast is the only speed we have left."
Amina moved deeper into the room, checking the walls with her headlamp. "Look, there's an access panel here. Probably ventilation or utilities."
Aya joined her. The panel was small, roughly fifty centimeters square, secured with screws.
"Can you open it?" Aya asked.
"Give me a minute." Amina pulled a multi-tool from her vest, began working on the screws. The first three came out smoothly, corroded but functional. The fourth fought her, stripped and fused. She applied pressure, twisted, and the screw head snapped off completely.
"Fuck." Amina stared at the broken screw, then shrugged. "Three out of four."
She pulled out a small pry bar and snapped the panel open, sending a loud clang through the stairwell. Behind the panel, darkness and the smell of old stone greeted them. 
A utility shaft, cut narrow and vertical, that climbed toward the floor above.
Aya stuck her head inside, looked up. Twelve meters of shaft, maybe fifteen. And at the top, dim light bleeding through another grate.
Floor eight, Aya thought. Malik's chamber.
"I'm going up," Aya said.
"The shaft's too narrow," Amina protested. "You'll get stuck."
"I'll fit. I need to see what we're up against."
Aya unhooked her pack and let it drop to Amina, then clipped her pistol tight against her chest to keep it from catching. 
“If I get stuck, pull,” she said, and didn’t wait for agreement.
Before Amina could argue further, Aya hoisted herself into the shaft. The space was tighter than she'd expected, her shoulders scraping both sides simultaneously. She braced her boots against one wall, her back against the other, and began climbing. Friction and pressure tore at her clothes as she used her legs to push herself upward, centimeter by centimeter of rough stone.
The climb was brutal. Every movement sent pain through her wounded side, where stitches pulled, and her leg, where the fresher stitches barely held. Her shoulders screamed from the awkward angle. Sweat ran down her face despite the cool air.
But she climbed.
Her watch read 10:54 PM. Thirty-six minutes until activation. She needed intel, and she needed it fast.
Three meters. Five. Eight.
The light above grew brighter. Voices filtered down, distorted by echo and distance but recognizable. Malik's voice, calm and measured, gave instructions. Another voice responding. Female, familiar. Leyla.
Ten meters. Twelve.
She reached the upper grate, pressed her face against the metal slats, and looked into the chamber beyond, before she nearly gasped.
The array was magnificent.
The entire eighth-floor chamber had been converted into something between laboratory and cathedral, centuries of research compressed into a single space. Computer monitors displayed real-time data feeds, energy measurements, and astronomical alignments, counting down by the second.
But the center was where Malik's obsession had taken physical form.
The array rose from floor to ceiling, a column of brass and crystal and impossible engineering. It looked like something from a steampunk fever dream, all exposed gears and precision-machined components and energy channels that glowed faintly blue. The crown lens sat at its heart, mounted in a cradle of brass rings that rotated on multiple axes, tracking the sky outside through windows positioned for perfect astronomical observation.
Around the lens, their other components had been integrated into the larger system amidst the pipes and gears. The focusing array branched out like metallic branches, each tip holding a crystal that caught light and held it. The calibration rings formed concentric circles, their surfaces etched with calculations so fine they were barely visible. Energy channels ran through everything, connecting components in patterns that hurt to look at directly.
It was beautiful. Terrible.
And it was working.
Even without activation, the system hummed with latent power. The air around it shimmered like heat haze. Small objects near the array floated slightly, gravity already beginning to warp. Reality was holding its breath.
Malik stood at a control panel, his back to Aya's position, hands moving across touchscreens and mechanical switches.
And beside him, helping position a component Aya couldn't identify—
Leyla.
She looked smaller than Aya remembered. Thinner. Dark circles under her eyes spoke of sleepless nights and suppressed guilt. Her hands moved carefully, but there was a tremor Aya could see even from this distance.
And across the chamber, helping lift equipment—
Emre.
He looked broken. Not physically, but the way he moved spoke of damage that went deeper than wounds. His shoulders hunched forward, and his eyes tracked the Aegis operatives stationed around the room's perimeter with the wariness of someone who'd learned not to trust.
But he was alive. And he and Leyla traded frequent glances, small looks of reassurance, of shared determination to survive this. They believed they would leave together when it was over.
Aya's hands clung to the grate.
She wanted to scream at them through the metal slats. Wanted to warn them that Malik would never let unnecessary witnesses live. That they were both dead the moment the activation finished. That every moment they helped him was another step toward their own executions.
But she couldn't. Could only watch as Leyla positioned components, following Emre’s calculated instructions with the compliance of someone who'd been taught what disobedience cost.
"Good work, Emre. The vision you’ve so kindly helped me construct is so close. But the secondary channels need calibration," Malik was saying, his voice carrying clearly through the shaft. "The energy flow must be precisely balanced across all nodes or the system will cascade unevenly."
"I'm seeing fluctuations in the third ring," Leyla responded, her technical knowledge evident. "Watch this. Twelve percent variance from baseline."
"Compensate with the focusing crystal. Angle it three degrees toward Regulus."
Emre shook his head. "That's not enough compensation for—"
"Three degrees. Trust the calculations." Malik's voice carried absolute certainty. "Hassan's research accounted for variance, and that’s what we’re going off of. The system self-corrects once activation begins."
At the mention of her father’s name, Aya’s jaw clenched so hard her teeth ached.
Malik continued working. "Emre, the primary lens needs cleaning. Dust accumulated during transport. Use the microfiber cloth, no pressure, circular motion."
Aya watched as Malik stepped back from the array, examining it with something approaching love. His hand reached out, almost but not quite touching the crown lens, and his expression shifted. Pride. Wonder. The face of someone who believed he was about to change human history.
"Thirty-three minutes," he said quietly. "Thirty-three minutes until alignment. Until we prove Hassan was wrong to hide this, that Çelebi was wrong, that all of history has been wrong to choose fear over progress."
He turned slightly, and for one breathless moment, Aya thought he could see her through the grate. But his gaze passed over her hiding spot, focused on the array, on his life's work finally realized.
"Begin final checks," he ordered. "Verify every connection, every channel, every component. I want zero variables when we activate."
"The stabilization array," Leyla said carefully. "You're certain we don't need—"
"It can’t be reconstructed, but we don't need it. Stability is not part of the bigger picture." Malik's interruption was sharp. "Plus, the system is designed with redundancy. Multiple pathways, multiple failsafes. If one component fails, others compensate. That's the genius of Çelebi's design, it's self-correcting, as organic as the stars it draws energy from once it gets going."
Except it wasn't, Aya thought, hopefully not. Not without the heavy wafer currently pressed against her ribs. Without it, the self-correction should fail. The system should cascade into instability. And Malik, for all his confidence, had no idea.
Aya committed everything to memory. The array's configuration. The positions of the Aegis operatives, six visible, certainly more out of sight. The locations of Leyla and Emre. The control panel where Malik worked. The energy channels that seemed most critical.
Then she began descending.
The climb down was faster, gravity assisting, her boots and back scraping against stone as she controlled her fall. Finally, she pulled herself through the opening, landing hard in the storage room where Amina and Karim waited.
"Well?" Amina asked immediately.
Aya checked her watch. 11:02 PM. Twenty-eight minutes left.
Aya pulled herself fully out of the shaft and took a moment to steady her breathing. "It's worse than we thought."
She described what she'd seen. The array's complexity. The redundant systems. The energy already building despite the system being inactive. Malik's confidence. The operatives positioned for security.
And Leyla and Emre, working together, believing they would survive.
"They don't know," Karim said quietly.
"No. They don't."
"Should we warn them?"
Aya wanted to. Despite everything, despite the betrayal, despite the rage that still burned in her chest, she wanted to warn them. Give them a chance to escape before the shooting started.
But reality was crueler than sentiment.
"We can't," she said. "Any attempt at communication tips our hand. Malik realizes we're here, he accelerates or aborts. We lose our only advantage."
"So we let them walk into an execution," Amina said flatly.
"We let them make their own choices. If they fight, if they run, if they finally see what Malik really is, that's on them. But we can't save them and stop him. We have to choose."
The silence that followed was heavy with implications.
Finally, Karim spoke. "What about the array itself? From what you described, destroying it won't be simple."
"No." Aya pulled out her phone and sketched what she'd seen.
Karim studied her sketch. "I recognize some of this. Hassan's work, but modified. Malik expanded the focusing array and added redundancy. See these secondary channels? If we only destroy the primary connections, the system routes energy through backup pathways."
"So we destroy everything simultaneously."
"In the middle of an energy discharge, while reality is potentially fracturing around us, while armed operatives are trying to kill us." Karim looked up, met her eyes. "This is suicide. We need to breach now and try to stop them."
"And if we destroy it during cascade, we contain the damage."
"We contain it to us."
The arithmetic was simple and brutal.
Aya pushed the thought away. Couldn't afford it. Not now.
"Charges are set," Karim said, moving back to examine his work. The shaped charges were positioned at structural weak points in the medieval ceiling, wired in series, ready to punch through the limestone in a single coordinated blast. "Detonator is here—" He placed the compact device on a metal shelf, its single red button gleaming dully in their headlamp beams. "Press it, and we have three seconds before the ceiling comes down. Maybe less."
Aya checked her weapon. Fourteen rounds in the magazine, one in the chamber. Forty-five more rounds in her vest pouches. Not enough if things went wrong. Never enough.
"We go now," she said, her decision crystallizing. "Before he activates. We breach, destroy the array, stop this before it starts."
"Agreed." Amina moved to position beside the breach point, her suppressed Glock held in a two-handed grip despite the pain Aya could see in how she favored her wounded side. "Waiting just gives them time to—"
Then she heard footsteps outside.
All three of them froze, weapons rising to low-ready positions. The footsteps echoed in the corridor outside. Multiple people.
Aya pressed her back against the wall beside the door, signaling Amina and Karim to positions with quick hand gestures. Through the narrow gap beneath the door, she could see shadows passing. Four sets of boots. Maybe five. Moving equipment past their position, coordinating on radios, voices too low to make out words.
The shadows stopped. Not now, Aya thought, not when we’re so close.
Aya's pulse hammered in her ears. She forced herself to breathe slowly, quietly, her finger resting alongside her weapon's trigger guard.
Three seconds of silence. Five. Seven.
Then a voice outside, sharp and clear through the door: "Thermal signature. Northwest storage room. Multiple contacts."
Shit.
"Karim—" Aya started, already knowing what had to happen.
The door handle turned.
"GET DOWN!" Amina shouted.
The door slammed open, and something small and cylindrical bounced across the floor, metallic clink loud in the confined space.
Aya's mind processed the shape—M84 stun grenade, pin pulled, spoon released, two-second fuse—and her body reacted before conscious thought could complete the calculation. She was already turning away, mouth open to equalize pressure, eyes squeezed shut, when the flashbang detonated.
Nine million candela.
One hundred and eighty decibels.
Chapter 45
The light hit first, visible even through closed eyelids, in a white-hot supernova that burned itself into her retinas. Then the pressure wave struck like a physical blow, overpressure slamming into her eardrums, her inner ear's balance system scrambled. Up became down. Left became right. The world tilted violently on an axis that didn't exist.
She fell without knowing she was falling.
The concrete floor hit her shoulder. The impact jarred through her chest, driving air from her lungs, her wounded leg screaming as stitches pulled, but the pain felt distant, processed through a nervous system that couldn't properly interpret signals anymore.
The ringing in her ears was so loud it became its own kind of silence. A high-pitched shriek that drowned out everything else. She couldn't hear the gunfire she knew had started, couldn't hear the screaming that might have been hers or someone else's.
But she could see muzzle flashes strobing through the white haze clouding her vision. Five of them. No, six, and more in the hall. Submachine guns firing in controlled bursts, professional spacing even in the confined room. Bullets sparked off metal shelving. Stone chips exploded from the walls. A round passed so close to her head that she felt the air wave part her hair.
Move. Move Aya. Remember your training.
The word surfaced through the chaos of her mind like debris through murky water. Her hand found her sidearm. She couldn't feel her fingers but watched them close around the grip. Muscle memory raised the Glock, combat stance coming automatically despite the vertigo trying to pull her sideways. Her finger found the trigger.
She fired blindly toward the doorway.
Three quick shots. The weapon kicked in her hands, recoil transmitted through bones and sinew. She couldn't hear the shots but felt them. Reset. Another three rounds. Another.
Her vision was clearing in spots, white-out fading to reveal shapes and shadows. An Aegis operative five meters away, MP5 tracking toward her position. Body armor visible. Ceramic plates over vital organs. Center mass shots would be wasted.
She adjusted her aim upward as he fired. His shot went wide, slightly disoriented by the same flashbang that had scrambled her equilibrium. Aya's next three rounds caught him in the throat above his armor's collar line. Blood sprayed in a mist backlit by muzzle flashes. He went down choking, hands clutching at the ruin of his neck.
The ringing didn’t stop, but it thinned, like someone slowly turning down a screaming radio. Sound leaked back in: the cough of suppressed shots, the slap of boots on concrete, someone shouting in the corridor.
Movement to her left. Another operative advancing on her position, weapon raised. Aya dove behind a shelving unit, her wounded leg buckling as she pushed off. She hit the floor hard, rolled, and came up with her weapon tracking. Rounds tore through the metal shelves above her, sparking, ricocheting. The shelves rang like bells under the impacts, a discordant percussion that cut through even the ringing in her ears.
The operative moved to flank her. Professional. Patient.
Aya came up firing and caught him in the face. Two rounds. His head snapped back, body following, falling backward into the doorway.
But more were coming through. She could see them now, pouring through the door, spreading to cover the room's angles. Close quarters battle, the kind of fighting where speed and aggression trumped precision. Where hesitation meant death.
Across the room, Amina moved.
She didn't run. Didn't dive. Just moved with that economy of motion that Aya had seen countless times, a predatory efficiency where every step served a purpose. One moment, she was behind cover, the next, she was closing distance with the nearest operative, inside his range before he could track her.
Her handgun fired twice, point-blank against the man’s face shield. Subsonic rounds punched through at an angle that sent him spinning sideways. He was still falling when Amina took his MP5 in one fluid motion, slung it, kept her pistol up, already tracking the next target.
But Aya could see the cost in how Amina moved, the slight hitch when she turned, the way her left hand pressed briefly against her wounded side before forcing itself back to the weapon. She was fighting through pain that should have dropped her, holding herself together through will and adrenaline and the knowledge that stopping meant dying.
Automatic fire ripped from Amina's captured rifle. Three-rounds. Shift. Three more. Another operative went down, then another, Amina's tactical sense reading the room's geometry, finding angles, exploiting cover.
As Aya tracked her, she caught a glimpse of Karim, pinned behind the shelf where the detonator sat, trying to return fire. His shots went wide, missing badly. An operative saw the weakness, the vulnerability, and advanced on him.
Aya moved. Pure reaction. 
Her Glock fell to the floor as she closed the distance in three strides, eating the space between them before the operative could register the threat shift. He was focused on Karim and realized too late that she was on him.
Her boot caught him behind the knee, a sharp Muay Thai kick that buckled his leg. He started to turn, MP5 swinging toward her, but she was already inside his guard. Her left hand trapped his weapon arm, driving it down and away. Her right hand found the knife strapped to her thigh.
The blade punched up under his chin where the helmet didn't reach, through soft tissue. A mercy kill. Quick. Efficient. He was dead before he understood he was dying.
She stepped back as his body dropped, knife coming free with a wet sound. Blood sprayed across her hands, warm and slick. The MP5 clattered to the floor beside him.
She snatched her Glock back up off the floor without looking, grip finding grip, and slid behind cover before the room could punish her for standing.
Rounds sparked off the concrete beside her. Stone chips bit into her cheek. One round ricocheted across the fabric of her vest, so close she felt the heat through her shirt.
Her magazine was empty.
Aya dropped behind cover, ejected the spent magazine, and reached for a fresh one. Her hands were shaking, the aftereffects of the flashbang and her countless injuries still scrambling her fine motor control. The magazine slipped from her fingers, clattered across the floor. She grabbed for it, missed, and grabbed again.
Radio chatter crackled from the corridor. Backup called. More operatives were coming. They had seconds, maybe less, before this went from desperate to impossible.
"Karim!" Aya shouted over the gunfire, her voice sounding distant and wrong through her damaged hearing. "BLOW IT! NOW!"
"We're not positioned, there's still—" Karim's voice was barely audible over the chaos.
"BLOW IT, OR WE DIE HERE!"
An Aegis operative's burst caught the shelf where the detonator sat. Wood splintered in a spray of fragments. Sparks flew from the detonator's casing—the circuit board visible through the cracked plastic, wires exposed, electronics smoking.
"Shit!" Karim stared at the sparking device, his face grey in the emergency lighting. "It might not—"
Another round of fire tore through the shelf, closer this time. The detonator sparked again, acrid smoke rising from damaged circuitry.
Karim grabbed the device, pressed the trigger button.
Nothing.
His thumb pressed again, repeatedly, desperately.
The charges didn't blow.
A man saw Karim with the detonator, understood what it meant. "BREACH CHARGES! They're trying to—"
Amina shot him mid-sentence. Three rounds to the chest that didn't penetrate his armor, then the fourth to his face. He went down hard.
Karim was shaking the detonator, checking connections, wires dangling from the cracked housing. "The circuit's broken. I need to… there's a manual bypass, but I need." He looked at his hands, at the wires, at the shelf disintegrating around them. "I can't hold it steady and connect the bypass. I need—"
Aya slapped her fresh magazine home, chambered a round, and sprinted across the room. Bullets tracked her movement, sparking off stone, tearing through the air centimeters from her body. Her wounded leg nearly buckled halfway across, but she caught herself, forced it to hold, and dove behind the shelf beside Karim.
Rounds chewed through the shelf above them. Wood and metal fragments rained down like shrapnel, cutting her face, her hands. The shelf tilted, about to collapse entirely.
"Tell me what to do!" She grabbed the detonator from him, stared at the exposed wiring. Three wires dangled from the cracked circuit board, red, green, and yellow. Burn marks on the plastic. Smell of fried electronics and her own blood.
"Red wire to the green terminal. No, the OTHER green terminal. There are two, you need the one closer to—"
Gunfire tore through the shelf inches from Aya's head. Wood exploded in her face. She ducked instinctively, almost dropped the detonator, and caught it against her chest. Her hands were shaking so badly she could barely separate the wires—they tangled, red touching yellow, sparks jumping between them.
"Which terminal? Karim, WHICH ONE?"
"Right side—your right—no wait, the terminal UNDER it—YES! That one!"
Rounds punched through the shelf six inches above her head. Karim pressed himself flat, covering his skull. Aya forced her hands to stop shaking through pure will.
She twisted the red wire around the terminal. It slipped off. Her fingers were wet with blood. She wiped them on her pants and tried again. The wire caught, held.
"Now the yellow to the red terminal. Careful, if it touches the housing first, it'll short and—"
An Aegis operative appeared above them, weapon pointing down over the shelf's edge.
Amina's pistol fired once from behind, and the operative's face disappeared in a spray of red. He fell backward.
Aya forced her hands steady, touched the yellow wire to the red terminal. Sparks flew. She jerked back, almost broke the connection.
"Hold it!" Karim grabbed her wrist and held it steady despite the rounds still impacting around them. "Just steady, and twist it on—"
The wire wrapped around the terminal. Held.
"Done!" Aya shoved the detonator toward Karim. "Now press—"
Karim's thumb found the button. Pressed.
One second. Two.
Nothing.
Then—
CRACK.
The first charge detonated. Not above them but across the room. The wrong sequence.
CRACK.
Second charge. Closer now.
CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.
The remaining charges blew in rapid succession, not simultaneously the way they were designed but in a cascade that ran across the ceiling like a fuse burning. The medieval limestone didn't punch upward cleanly. It SHATTERED. Blocks of stone that had held for six centuries fractured along fault lines, coming down in chunks ranging from fist-sized to the size of a motorcycle.
A limestone block the size of a desk crushed the Aegis op closest to the door, the impact wet and final. Blood sprayed from beneath the stone, spreading in a pool that mixed with dust and debris.
The closest operative to him tried to run, and managed to dodge the first block, but the ceiling collapsed onto him, a ton of masonry driving him to the floor. Aya heard bones breaking, a sound like wet wood snapping, before the dust cloud swallowed everything.
The air filled instantly with choking dust, a storm of pulverized stone that burned her lungs with each breath. She couldn't see three feet in any direction. Couldn't hear anything except the rumble of collapsing stone and the ringing that still filled her ears.
But through the dust cloud, above them, she could see light.
The breach had opened. Jagged. Unstable. Debris still falling. But open.
"GO!" Aya pushed Karim toward where the opening had to be. "Move! NOW!"
She couldn't see Amina in the dust but trusted she was moving. Trusted she'd understood.
Aya climbed on top of the shelving, and her hands found the breach edge. The limestone was ragged, sharp, with edges like knives. She grabbed anyway and felt stone slice her palms as she pulled herself up. Her boots scrambled for purchase on crumbling rock.
Something grabbed her ankle.
Aya looked down through swirling dust, saw a hand, blood-covered and desperate, wrapped around her boot. The face emerged from the haze below, grey with dust, eyes wide with pain and rage, and the determination of a dying man taking enemies with him.
He pulled. Her grip on the edge slipped. Stone cut deeper into her palms. She was sliding backward, being dragged down into the chaos below, where more Aegis men were recovering, where going back meant death.
Aya kicked. Her free boot connected with his face. Felt his nose break under her heel. Bone and cartilage collapsing. He screamed, and his grip loosened. She kicked again, harder. His hand released. He fell backward into the darkness.
She pulled herself through the breach, emerging into—
Light.
Not normal light. Energy light. The kind of illumination that shouldn't exist in nature, that hurt to look at directly. 
The activation had already begun.
Behind her, Amina vaulted through the breach, her face grey with dust and pain, blood running from her side. She still had her captured MP5 in one hand, her pistol in the other. Still scanning for threats.
Then Karim pulled himself up on the far edge, his face bloodless, shock settling in, eyes unfocused. But he was moving.
Below them, in the storage room, the surviving operatives were recovering. Aya could hear them through the breach, weapons being checked and radios crackling.
"Ceiling!" Aya shouted to Karim. "Can you drop it?"
He looked at the breach edges, at the unstable stone. Reached into his vest and pulled out their last few charges, and barely took time to position them against the breach's edge before activating the timer.
"Fire in the hole!"
They dove away from the breach.
The charge detonated. The remaining fragments along the edge collapsed inward, limestone blocks falling, sealing the hole. Below, Aya heard screaming—brief, then cut off as tons of medieval stone finished burying everything beneath. The floor beneath them buckled, cracked, threatened to give way entirely before settling into an uneasy stability.
The screaming stopped.
They were trapped on the eighth floor now. No way back down except through Malik's position. No extraction except forward, through whatever waited.
Aya pushed herself to her feet, gun coming up automatically, knife still strapped to her thigh, and turned to face the chamber.
Then she stopped breathing.
The array at the room's center already blazed like a captured star.
Chapter 46
Aya breached through the explosion's wake, weapon raised, and bullets immediately tore through the air where her head had been.
No standoff. No demands. Just instant violence.
She threw herself right as a hail of bullets sparked off the doorframe. Karim dove left. Amina rolled forward into cover behind a toppled equipment rack.
The chamber was a cathedral of impossible physics and immediate death.
Malik stood at his control panel across the room, hands moving across screens that scrolled too fast to read. He'd glanced at them when they breached, gave one look of calm acknowledgment, then returned to the array as if armed intruders were merely an expected complication.
"Aya Amrani, you came. Good, that’ll make this so much more interesting," Malik called over the chaos. His voice was unnaturally calm. "I especially hoped you'd see this, Aya."
Four Aegis guards held positions between the team and the array. Two more flanked Malik. Professional spacing. Overlapping fields of fire.
Muzzle flashes strobed from three positions. Aegis operatives already firing, already moving, professional and fast. Return fire cracked from Amina's position. One operative staggered, chest blooming red.
Aya fired twice. A second operative went down, but there were so many more.
The array blazed at the chamber's center, the crown lens rotating faster than physics should allow. Energy poured through crystalline channels like liquid light, branching and splitting and recombining in patterns that hurt to track. The focusing array had become something alive, its brass surfaces rippling with heat haze, its gears turning by unseen power.
And the air was wrong.
Karim's eyes were locked on the array, his archaeologist's brain processing what Malik had built from Hassan's research. "My God," he whispered. "It's beautiful."
"Isn't it?" Malik's voice carried genuine pleasure. "Your father would have wept to see it, Aya. All his theories, finally realized."
Gravity pulled at Aya's body in multiple directions simultaneously. A shell casing floated past her face, rotating slowly, before suddenly accelerating sideways and embedding itself in the wall with the force of a bullet.
"Contact left!" Karim yelled.
Two more Aegis operatives emerged from behind the array, weapons raised. Aya fired, but the bullet curved mid-flight, following a gravity that didn't point down anymore. It struck stone three feet from her target.
Amina broke from cover, moving to flank, fast and low.
The Aegis operative tracking her adjusted aim. Fired.
Aya could only watch as the bullets collided with Amina mid-stride.
She jerked backward as rounds punched through her right flank, just below her ribs. Blood sprayed. Her momentum carried her into cover, but she hit the ground hard, gasping.
"Amina!" Aya's voice cut through the gunfire.
"I'm good!" Amina shouted back, but her voice was strained. Wrong. She pressed both hands against her stomach. Blood welled between her fingers. "Still in this!"
She raised her weapon one-handed and returned fire that forced her pursuer back into cover.
But Aya saw the truth. Saw blood pooling beneath Amina's position, her face hung with pain and shock while she tried to stay in the fight as her body bled out.
Across the chamber, partially hidden behind equipment racks, Leyla watched the same thing.
Watched Amina get shot. Watched her go down. Watched her struggling to keep fighting while blood spread across the stone.
Leyla's hand was pressed against Emre's chest, while her other hand gripped a wrench she’d been using on Malik’s assembly. 
And in that moment, Aya saw something shift in her expression. But there was no time to process.
A ribbon of energy lashed out from the array, cutting the air inches from Aya's face. She threw herself left, shoulder slamming into fallen equipment. The energy carved through stone where she'd been standing, leaving a glowing scar that aged and crumbled in seconds.
Time itself was fracturing.
"Move!" she barked.
Karim scrambled behind a toppled control panel, his pry bar clattering against brass tubing. An operative moved to cut him off. Aya released three shots, and he went down.
Papers scattered from Malik's control panel as another shockwave rippled through the chamber. Karim's hand shot out reflexively, closing on a flurry of documents before they could be incinerated by an energy discharge. He quickly stuffed them into his vest without looking.
Then, the floor buckled. Aya grabbed a support beam to stay upright as stone rippled like water.
"Phase three in sixty seconds," Malik announced. "Crown lens approaching full charge."
The crown lens pulsed. The energy channels flared. The room itself flexed, walls bending before snapping back to geometry.
One of the windows exploded outward. Glass fragmented into millions of pieces, suspended in the air, defying gravity before plummeting to the street below.
"Structural integrity compromised," an Aegis operative reported into his radio. "Energy discharge exceeding parameters."
"Within margins," Malik said without looking up. "Minor fluctuations."
But Aya could see the lie in how his hands moved. Faster now. Less confident.
A chunk of limestone floated past, drifted over the array. She watched it age in seconds. Solid grey stone becoming porous, brown, crumbling to dust.
Amina shifted position, trying to get a better angle. Her movement was wrong. Slower. Favoring her left side. Blood trail marked her path.
She raised her weapon. Fired. The operative she'd been tracking went down with a scream.
But the cost showed in her face. Each movement tearing at the wounds in her torso. Each breath shallow and pained.
"Secondary array overheating," Leyla called out from her position near the control panels. Her voice carried an edge. "Forty percent above specifications."
"Compensate with cooling channels," Malik ordered.
"Already at maximum. We're losing containment on three nodes."
Malik's jaw clenched. "Reroute through backup pathways."
The lens pulsed brighter, rotation accelerating. Energy poured through the focusing array like water finding channels, feeding back into itself, building toward something catastrophic.
Another window shattered. Cold air poured in.
Sirens wailed in the distance. Emergency services responding to explosions.
They had minutes.
"Karim," Aya said quietly, weapon tracking the nearest guard. "The array. Where do we hit it? We need to move."
He'd been studying the energy patterns. "The focusing crystals." He pointed with the pry bar at three crystalline structures branching from the main column. "Destroy them and the system loses coherence."
"How long until that kills everyone here?"
"Minutes. Maybe less."
"And if we wait until Malik completes activation?"
"City-wide discharge. Millions dead. Istanbul tears itself apart."
The arithmetic was unchanged. Sacrifice everyone here to save everyone outside.
Aya glanced around the room as an Aegis guard near the window aged forty years in three seconds. His face lined, hair grayed, body hunching before time snapped back, and he was young again, gasping in horror. Like time hiccuped forward, then corrected.
"Temporal fluctuation," Leyla yelled. "Energy bleed-through. Time dilation affecting personnel."
"They'll stabilize," Malik said, though his eyes lingered on the operative.
But Aya could see the lie. The cascade was building faster than his models predicted. The system was failing. Working well enough to be catastrophic but failing nonetheless.
The floor buckled again. A section near the western wall collapsed, revealing the floor below.
Amina tried to move to better cover. Her legs nearly gave out. She caught herself against the equipment, leaving a bloody handprint on the brass.
Aya watched Amina struggle and could feel the fear clouding her judgment. 
And across the chamber, Leyla saw it too as she watched Amina clinging to her position, blood pooling beneath her, while Aya's team fought impossible odds, while the array tore reality apart.
Malik's central radio crackled with a response. Aegis transmission from somewhere below: "Control, this is Omega team. Standing by for cleanup protocol following phase three."
Malik's response was instant: "After activation, initiate cleanup protocol. All non-essential personnel."
The words hung in the superheated air.
No witnesses.
Aya watched as Leyla's hand tightened on Emre's arm. Her eyes scanned the firing squad of Aegis operatives. Saw them repositioning. Small movements. Two had shifted to block the exits. Another had moved closer to her position.
She'd just realized they were never walking out of here.
Aya fired at the closest guard to her left.
Leyla's gaze found Emre across the room. Their eyes locked. No words passed between them. Just knowledge that they were dead either way.
Leyla's gaze found Aya across the chamber. For one moment, their eyes locked.
And something passed between them that didn't need language. Guilt. Apology. Acceptance. Understanding. 
Aya gave the smallest nod.
"Thirty seconds to full activation," Malik announced. "Crown lens approaching critical charge."
The array blazed. The lens became a blur. Energy poured through channels that glowed white-hot.
Aya watched as Leyla suddenly grabbed a wrench from the work table while Emre picked up a length of pipe. They moved together with silent coordination, through the chaos, from behind Malik.
The Aegis operative covering Malik’s position was focused on Aya, weapon raised, tracking her movement behind cover.
He never saw them coming.
Leyla's wrench caught him across the back of the skull. Bone cracked. He went down screaming. Emre's pipe followed, brutal and final.
The man's weapon clattered across the floor.
"Finish them all," Malik shouted without looking up from his screens. “What are you waiting for?”
The second man guarding him turned his weapon on Leyla and Emre.
But in turning, he'd exposed his flank to Amina's position.
She took the shot. Three quick staccato bursts.
As the man fell, it created a gap, an opening in the defensive line between the team and the array.
"Now!" Leyla screamed at Aya. Not for herself. For them. "Get to the array! We'll hold them!"
A third operative swung his weapon toward Leyla just as she turned her focus to Malik in the center. 
Emre lunged in front of her.
The bullets caught him full in the chest. He jerked backward, blood spraying across Leyla, then fell with a thud on the shuddering stone floor.
"No!" Leyla's scream tore through the chaos.
She threw herself at the man, wrench swinging wildly. At close range, she caught him across the jaw. He staggered. She hit him again. And again.
"Karim!" Aya roared. "Now!"
He didn't hesitate. Ran through the opening that Leyla and Emre had died to create. Boots pounding stone. Pry bar raised.
Then another Aegis operative fired from across the chamber.
Bullets punched through her chest. Through her back. 
She collapsed beside Emre as their hands found each other, fingers interlacing one final time. 
Blood spreading. Life leaving. But they'd done it.
The gap remained. The path to the array was open.
Aya fired on the only guard close enough to stop Karim and caught him twice. He crumpled onto the floor as she fired again, finishing him off.
Karim reached the array.
Aya’s ribs ached where the stabilization wafer was strapped inside her vest, still there, still their only real leverage. But there was no clean mount point now, no calm moment to seat it into a mechanism that was actively trying to rewrite gravity.
For one crystalline moment, he saw what he was about to destroy. The culmination of genius. Çelebi's vision. Hassan's research. Knowledge passed through centuries.
Beautiful. Terrible. Wrong.
Every instinct screamed to stop. To study rather than destroy.
But he saw Leyla and Emre's bodies behind him. Saw Amina bleeding out. Saw the temporal distortions aging stone and flesh.
 “Rings first to break alignment. Then the crystals to kill coherence,” Karim called out. "Some things shouldn't exist."
He brought the pry bar down on the first calibration ring with all his strength.
Brass cracked. Energy exploded outward.
The backlash caught Karim like a fist and threw him across the chamber. His body slammed into the wall with bone-breaking force. He collapsed, gasping.
Aya fired at the focusing crystals. The bullet struck dead center. The crystal shattered.
She dropped her empty magazine and slammed in her last spare. Twelve rounds. She'd have to make them count.
The array screamed.
Energy that had been flowing through carefully designed channels suddenly lost coherence. The cascade became violently unstable. The crown lens pulsed once, twice, three times, each pulse brighter than the last.
"No!" Malik spun toward them. "The cascade is reversing! Protect the array!"
His remaining guards opened fire.
Muzzle flashes lit the chamber like strobes. Bullets tore through equipment, ricocheted off stone, punched through reality-warped air in trajectories that curved impossibly.
Amina returned fire from her position, weapon coughing three-round bursts. Her aim was steady despite the blood loss. Aya caught a glimpse of her in awe.
The crown lens pulsed again. Brighter. The light left afterimages. Energy poured out uncontrolled, striking walls, ceiling, floor. Stone cracked. Metal melted. The air itself screamed.
The floor tilted fifteen degrees and stayed tilted. Gravity lurched. For three seconds, Aya floated, boots lifting off stone, before reality slammed her back down.
An Aegis operative near the window wasn't as lucky. He lifted off the ground, tumbled sideways, and went through the shattered window frame. His scream cut off abruptly.
"Don't," Aya warned, weapon tracking him, but the angle was impossible. The crown lens was positioned between her and any clean shot.
Malik saw her hesitation and smiled.
"No—”
Malik turned. The word came from behind him. Weak and broken, but defiant.
Karim was pushing himself off the wall, his shattered body protesting every movement. His broken arm hung useless, twisted at an angle that made Aya's stomach turn. Blood ran from his nose, his ears, down his chin. But his good hand gripped a jagged length of brass torn from the destroyed array.
"Karim, don't!" Amina gasped from her position, one hand pressed to her bleeding side.
But he was already moving.
Years of cautious methodology. A lifetime of choosing preservation over action, safety over risk. Every artifact he'd protected. Every time, he'd chosen the careful path.
All of it had led to this moment.
Malik's eyes widened as Karim closed the distance. "You can barely stand. What do you think you're—"
Karim swung his makeshift weapon with every ounce of strength his broken body could summon.
It caught Malik across his wounded shoulder, metal striking the transforming flesh. The impact tore through tissue that glowed faintly blue.
Malik staggered backward, blood spraying.
"You—" Malik started, rage flashing across his face. His eyes went wide with shock and pain. That someone this broken would try. That it actually hurt.
Then his other hand came up as a sneer crossed his face, and reality bent again.
The air between them compressed. Gravity inverted in a localized sphere, pulling in multiple directions simultaneously. Karim hit the invisible barrier as if he'd run into a wall. The jagged brass pipe flew from his hand, clattering across the tilting floor.
Then the gravity well reversed and became a push.
Karim was airborne, weightless for one terrible second before the force violently slammed him backward.
He hit the wall with a devastating impact. Stone cracked beneath him. Something in his chest snapped, crunching. More ribs. His skull bounced off stone.
He finally collapsed to the floor in a broken heap, gasping for air that wouldn't come. Drowning, unable to draw air.
And then the crown lens went nova.
Light swallowed everything. The last thing Aya saw was Karim's body crumpling against stone. Then the world went white.
Chapter 47
Light.
Then sensation returning in fragments.
Aya's ears rang with a high-pitched shriek that drowned out everything else. Her vision was white, then grey, then shapes slowly resolving through the haze. She was on the ground. When had she fallen?
Her hands found stone. Pushed up. The world tilted violently before stabilizing.
The chamber swam into focus.
Destroyed. The array torn apart, brass and crystal scattered across stone. Smoke filled the air. And the light - the terrible light from the crown lens that still blazed at the chamber's heart.
Light that existed in dimensions that perception couldn't process. Light that was thought and energy and fundamental force combined into something that burned without heat and illuminated without casting shadows.
The crown lens blazed at the array's heart, drinking the cascade's energy, channeling force Aya couldn't comprehend through its crystalline structure in patterns that looked almost like writing. Almost like consciousness.
Aya threw her arm across her eyes, but the light penetrated anyway. She could see her own bones through her flesh, could see air molecules dancing, could see the flat circle of time itself spinning around obstacles like water around stones.
The array was dying. But the lens was waking.
Karim still lay crumpled against the wall where he’d been thrown twice. His body was a ruin. One arm bent at an impossible angle. His chest caved in wrong. Blood ran from his nose and ears, pooling beneath him. He shouldn't be conscious. But his eyes were open, staring at what he'd done with an expression caught between horror and awe.
"It’s broken," he gasped, coughing blood. Each word cost him. "We broke—" Another cough, wet and rattling. "—the containment."
"You saved the city," Aya shouted back over the roar of uncontrolled energy discharge.
"Did I?"
The question hung there because the answer wasn't clear. 
Yes, the cascade was failing, the carefully balanced system Malik had built, tearing itself apart. The focusing crystals she'd shot were shattering further, sending cracks racing through their structures. The calibration rings Karim had struck were fragmenting, their precision geometry dissolving into a chaotic flow of energy from deep space.
It redirected. Poured into the crown lens with increasing violence, feeding it, charging it, transforming it from component into conduit.
Malik remained at his control panel, hands frozen on screens that showed nothing but red warnings and system failures. For a moment, he just stared. His jaw worked. His hands lifted from the controls, then lowered, then lifted again—the gestures of a man reaching for something that was no longer there.
Then his expression changed. His eyes widened. His mouth opened slightly. Hands moved across the screens with renewed purpose.
"It's not shutting down," he said, voice barely audible over the energy discharge. "It's concentrating."
He was right. Without the focusing array to distribute energy across multiple channels, without the calibration rings to balance the flow, without the stabilization systems to control the cascade, the raw dimensional power was pouring directly into the crown lens.
Feeding it. Saturating it. Transforming it from a component designed to redirect energy into a battery that stored it.
"The lens is charging," Malik continued, hands moving across controls with a different purpose. Not trying to salvage the activation. Trying to record what was happening. "My God, it's actually charging. Hassan never tested this. It is possible."
The floor buckled violently, cracking in spiderwebs from the array's base. The section where Leyla and Emre's bodies lay tilted fifteen degrees before snapping back to horizontal. Their corpses shifted, but their hands remained interlaced.
Aya's chest tightened. They'd died to create the opening. To give Karim the chance. 
She forced herself to look away. Grief later. Survival now.
Gravity lurched. For three seconds, Aya floated, boots lifting off the floor, before gravity reasserted itself and slammed her back down hard enough to jar her teeth.
Two operatives remained standing, weapons trained on Aya's position. But they looked uncertain now, their training useless against physics that made no sense.
"Fall back to rally point beta!" one barked into his radio. "Tower is compromised. Repeat, tower is—"
A section of the ceiling collapsed onto him, and he disappeared under a ton of limestone, transmission cutting off mid-word.
The last operative looked at the rubble, at the array tearing reality apart, at Malik, who was ignoring the collapse to record data, and made a calculation that survival meant extraction.
He ran for the stairs.
Amina tried to raise her weapon, but her hands were slick with blood. She fired blind, three rounds that curved mid-flight in the warped gravity and embedded in stone.
"Fuck this," Amina gasped, one hand pressed to her ribs. Blood seeped between her fingers, pooling on the stone beneath her. And she was running low on ammunition. Not that she could aim anymore.  "Aya—" Amina's voice was weak, thready. "We need to— the tower—" She couldn't finish. Blood loss stealing words along with strength.
"Working on it." Aya pushed herself up, moved toward the array in a crouch, weapon raised. Her boots scraped stone that felt solid one moment and liquid the next.
She was three meters from the crown lens when Malik stepped into her path.
No weapon. Just standing, arms at his sides, his expression serene despite everything collapsing around him. The light from the lens cast shadows that moved independently of their source, writhing across his face in patterns that suggested things with too many angles.
"You destroyed my work," Malik said calmly.
"Yes, we did."
"Thank you, you’ve proven what I only speculated."
Aya's finger tightened on the trigger, but didn't fire. "What?"
"I built to a theory. Calculated. Predicted. But I didn't know." Malik gestured to the crown lens blazing behind him, to the energy pouring into it with increasing violence. "Now I do. The lens doesn't just redirect dimensional energy. It stores it. Concentrates it. Everything that passes through leaves traces. Patterns. Knowledge."
He took a step closer. Aya raised her weapon, but he ignored it with the wave of his hand.
"The array was a tool," he continued. "A means to an end. But the lens is the real work. I suppose Çelebi knew that, but Hassan and I never did. You can destroy the machinery, but the lens remains. Charged. Waiting."
"I'm going to smash it into dust."
"Then you kill millions." Malik gestured to his screens. "The array channeled energy safely. Without it, the lens is saturated. Stable while contained, catastrophic if ruptured. A bullet doesn't destroy it cleanly. It cracks the crystalline structure and releases everything at once." He raised his transformed hands, light pulsing beneath the skin. "But I can carry it. The energy recognizes what I'm becoming. It flows through me instead of against me."
"You're lying."
"He's not—" Karim's voice broke, barely audible over the discharge. He tried to push himself upright, failed, and slumped back. "The lens. It's holding everything. Destroy it and—" He coughed, foam at his lips. "—everyone dies."
"And the destruction of Istanbul is blood on your hands," Malik finished. "You stopped the apparatus to save the city. But the lens remains. Charged. Unstable. Impossible to destroy without finishing what you fought to prevent." His expression was almost sympathetic. "Checkmate. It’s a solved position, Aya."
The word hung because Aya knew they were true. They'd stopped the apparatus. Saved the city from immediate catastrophe. And accomplished nothing that mattered.
The lens remained. Charged. Dangerous.
Then the crown lens pulsed again, and something looked back.
Aya felt it. Not saw. Felt. A presence that existed in the light, in the energy, in the space between dimensions. Something vast and ancient and utterly alien turning its attention toward the chamber.
Malik felt it too. His confident expression cracked, and his pupils dilated. His hands, still resting on the screens, had begun to tremble. "Dear God," he whispered. "It's aware."
The presence pressed against reality like a hand against a membrane. The air thickened. Sound became visual, light became tactile. Aya could taste electricity, could hear colors, could see music in the way energy moved.
Karim collapsed against the wall, blood pouring from his nose as he screamed in pain.
"Hold on!" Amina was crawling toward Karim, leaving a blood trail across tilted stone. Each movement tore at the wounds in her side. The air was dense as water, but that wasn't what was killing her. Every step was labor. Every breath burned.
And the crown lens showed them what it had learned.
Images flashed through the light. Patterns preserved in the crystalline structure.
Aya saw Çelebi in his workshop, testing the lens. Triumph shifting to horror as he understood what he'd built. She saw him hiding the components across the Ottoman Empire, leaving instructions that they should never be reunited.
She saw older echoes. Çelebi studying texts that predated the Ottomans by centuries. Temple diagrams, a script that Aya couldn’t place.
So the lens hadn't been invented in Istanbul, Aya thought. It had been copied from something older.
Malik's eyes widened, drinking in the images. "Cambodia," he breathed. "The Devaraja system. It's real. This was never the original. Just a copy of what the Khmer built first."
More images. Stone temples. A king walking through a carved chamber, approaching a series of fully-formed dimensional barriers.
And beneath it all. The original lens. Carved from crystal that didn't exist in nature, waiting in darkness beneath jungle temples.
The visions cut off abruptly. The crown lens pulsed three times, each weaker than the last, before settling into a steady glow.
Meanwhile, the energy discharge was declining as the cosmic alignment window passed. But it wasn’t fully stopping. It would take hours for the lens to fully drain. But no longer building. The cascade had plateaued.
Aya stood in the near silence, processing what she'd seen. What they'd all seen. What Malik had learned.
"That's why Hassan was running tests," Karim said from his position against the wall. Voice weak but steady. "The research he was doing. He wasn't just studying Çelebi. He was tracking the knowledge backward. Trying to find the source. Hamza said he’d done work in Cambodia."
"And I killed him before he could find out exactly what I've just learned." Malik's jaw tightened. His eyes dropped for a second. Then his chin lifted again. "His loss. My gain."
He moved toward the crown lens, hands reaching.
Aya's weapon rose before conscious thought completed. Her finger was on the trigger, pressure building, the shot half-fired when Karim's voice cut through: "AYA! THE LENS!"
She froze. Breathing hard. Her vision narrowed to a tunnel. Just Malik's face, just his mouth forming those words, just the casual admission that he'd murdered her father.
Her weapon’s sights lined up perfectly with Malik's forehead, her hand steady despite the rage that burned behind her ribs like a second heartbeat.
One shot. That's all it would take. One shot to end the man who'd killed her father.
And kill everyone in a three-kilometer radius. Her finger trembled on the trigger. Two pounds of pressure between revenge and catastrophe.
"Don't," she finally said. To Malik. To herself. To the weapon that wanted to fire.
Her hand didn't lower. Didn't waver. Just held there with the perfect shot, impossible to take.
"Why? You're not going to shoot me. Not with the lens in this state. A bullet hits it wrong, you get exactly the discharge you've been trying to prevent."
He was right, and he knew it. Aya’s finger stayed off the trigger. Her aim tracked him, but didn't fire.
"Winter solstice is in seventy-three days." Malik's hand reached toward the lens. "That's when I'll finish what Hassan and I started. What even Çelebi couldn't complete."
"You're insane."
"I'm necessary." 
His fingers closed around the crown lens, gripping the charged crystal with both hands, and the energy surged through him like lightning through copper.
He screamed. Light poured from his mouth, his eyes, the spaces between his fingers. His veins glowed beneath his skin, mapping circulatory systems that burned with dimensional energy. He convulsed, body arcing backward, every muscle locked in spasm.
In that moment of contact, the lens coursed through him. Downloaded everything it had learned. Centuries of accumulated knowledge pouring into a human consciousness that wasn't designed to receive it.
Aya saw it happen through the light.
He was transforming. Changing. Becoming something that existed between human and whatever consciousness lived in dimensional spaces.
Malik finally released the lens, staggering backward, hands smoking.
His skin was translucent. Light moved beneath it like blood, glowing faintly blue. His eyes had changed, pupils dilating and contracting independently.
When he spoke, his voice resonated with strange harmonics. "I understand. God help me, I understand everything."
He looked at his hands, watched the light moving beneath his skin. "The lens remembers. All of it. The system. The Devaraja ritual." His gaze found Aya. "I saw what I'm becoming."
"What are you becoming?"
"A bridge. Between dimensions. The transformation will take weeks. But it's begun."
The tower groaned, deeper than before. The floor tilted five degrees and stayed tilted. Somewhere below, multiple stories were giving way.
"Aya—" Amina's voice was barely a whisper. Her face had gone grey, lips pale. "I don’t want to fucking die here..."
She was fading. Going into shock. Minutes left, maybe less.
"I won’t let that happen. We go now," Aya said.
But Malik was moving toward the crown lens again, his glowing hands reaching to take it.
"This comes with me," he said. He carefully extracted the lens from its cradle. The brass rings sparked and protested but released their prize. He cradled the crystal against his chest, his wounded shoulder hunched protectively.
Aya's weapon tracked him as he moved toward the stairs, but the angle was impossible. The crown lens was positioned between her and any clean shot, one stray round away from city-wide destruction.
Malik saw her hesitation. "Smart choice, Aya Amrani." His wounded shoulder left a blood trail on the wall as he moved. He was three meters from the stairwell when Karim pushed himself off the wall.
Aya's weapon swung toward Malik, but the lens was still there, still charged, still impossible to risk.
Malik looked down at Karim, struggling to breathe. His glowing eyes studied the broken archaeologist for a long moment.
"You actually tried," he said quietly. "Despite everything. Despite knowing you'd fail."
The tower groaned. Deep and fundamental. The floor tilted another five degrees. A section of the ceiling near the windows collapsed, admitting smoke and cold air and the distant sound of sirens.
Malik's attention snapped to the structure failing around them. His transformed hand pressed against his wounded shoulder—Karim's blow had cut deeper than he'd shown. Blue light leaked between his fingers alongside the blood.
"I could kill you here," he said, almost conversationally. "But the tower won't wait, and honestly?" A strange smile crossed his luminous features. "I want you to see what I become. I want Hassan's daughter to understand what her father could have been part of."
Behind him, the lens's empty cradle sparked and died. Above, the sound of rotors. A helicopter.
"Seventy-three days," Malik said, reaching the stairwell door. Blood ran down his arm, dripping onto stone. "I'll complete what your father started, and it will be a glorious victory for all of humanity."
Then he was gone, running up the stairs toward the roof, toward Aegis extraction, leaving blood on the stones behind him.
Aegis had timed it perfectly, the helicopter already in hover, a rope line dropping past the shattered observation deck like they’d rehearsed this ending.
Aya took three steps after him before the floor buckled completely. A section of stone near the western wall gave way entirely, opening a hole straight down to the sixth floor.
"Aya!" Amina grabbed her arm with bloody hands. "We can't—"
She collapsed. Legs giving out. Blood loss stealing her consciousness.
Aya caught her before she hit the ground. "Amina! Stay with me!"
The floor tilted another ten degrees. A support column cracked with an explosion of dust and debris. The western wall began folding inward.
"Karim," Aya called across the chamber. "Can you walk?"
He tried to answer, but only coughed blood.
She moved to Karim first, grabbed his good arm, and hauled him upright. He screamed. The sound cut through everything.
"I know it hurts," she said. "But you move, or we all die here."
She got her shoulder under his arm, half-carried, half-dragged him across the tilting floor toward where Amina had fallen.
Amina was still conscious, but barely. Her eyes found Aya's. "Leave me. Get him out."
"Not a fucking chance."
Aya positioned Karim against the wall. "Hold on to something. Don't pass out. You’ve got this."
Then she went for Amina. Grabbed her under the arms. Amina's scream joined Karim's as movement tore her wounds open further.
The ceiling groaned. Cracks raced across stone.
"Karim! Move! Now!"
He pushed off the wall, staggered three steps before nearly falling. Aya caught him with her right arm while supporting Amina with her left.
Together, the three of them stumbled toward the stairwell, Karim gasping with every step, Amina leaving a blood trail, Aya's body screaming from supporting both their weight.
Behind them, the array stood dark and broken.
They'd stopped the activation. Destroyed the apparatus. Prevented city-wide catastrophe.
And potentially lost everything that mattered.
The stairwell door was ten feet away. Might as well have been a mile.
"Five more steps," Aya said. "Come on. Five more."
Four.
Three.
The floor buckled completely. A section near the array collapsed into the level below.
Two.
One.
Aya's hand found the door and yanked it open. They stumbled through into smoke-filled darkness.
Above them, the eighth floor imploded. Stone and brass and history falling.
The door slammed shut behind them, cutting off the chaos.
Just three people in a stairwell. Two of them dying. One of them trying to get them all out before the tower finished collapsing.
Aya looked down at Karim hanging off her left side, Amina off her right.
"Another flight now," she said. "We’ve done so many hard things together. Just keep moving."
And they descended into darkness, racing the collapse, carrying the weight of failure and survival in equal measure.
Chapter 48
With Aya’s third kick, the ground-floor door burst open, debris spilling outward, admitting cold air and the sounds of Istanbul in crisis.
Amina clung to her while Aya grabbed Karim and dragged him through.
They emerged into chaos that made the tower's interior seem almost quiet by comparison.
Emergency vehicles everywhere. Ambulances, fire trucks, police cars, their lights painting the night in strobing colors. Crowds held back by hastily erected barriers, phones out, filming the disaster, social media spreading images faster than authorities could control.
Bodies lay under white sheets. Aya counted eight. Then twelve. Then stopped counting because the numbers kept rising and she couldn't process them yet.
The tower loomed behind them, still collapsing in slow motion. The upper floors had imploded entirely, compressing down into rubble. The middle floors groaned and cracked. Only the lowest levels remained relatively intact, stone bases that had weathered centuries now facing their final minutes.
Fires burned in three adjacent buildings. The debris field spread across the Galata district like shrapnel, cars crushed under limestone blocks, storefronts demolished, history destroying itself in real-time.
A vehicle screeched to a stop beside them. Omar's black BMW X3, passenger door already swinging open.
"GET IN!" Omar wore a look of terror behind the dashboard lights. "Now! Before the police cordon tightens!"
They hauled Karim toward the vehicle. He was completely unconscious, body limp, breathing shallow.
Getting him into the back seat was brutal, desperate lifting and shoving, Amina climbing in first to pull what little she could while Aya pushed from behind. Karim's head lolled against the seat. Blood ran from his mouth.
Aya climbed in after him, cradled his head in her lap. Amina pressed both hands against the wound in his side, applying pressure, trying to slow the bleeding that wouldn't stop.
"Hospital?" Omar asked, engine already running, ready to drive.
"No," Aya said. "Hospital means questions. Questions mean police. Police mean Aegis finding us within hours. Can your contacts get us a private clinic?"
"He might die before we get there. Amina, how are you?"
"I’ll live, but with Aegis still around, we'll definitely die if we take us to a hospital."
Omar floored it.
They careened through Istanbul streets, now transformed by emergency response. Police were trying to establish cordons, but the chaos was too widespread, too many casualties, too much confusion. Omar weaved through traffic, jumping sidewalks, cutting through alleys, navigating by desperation.
Karim's breathing grew wetter. Each inhalation produced a rattling sound that spoke of systems shutting down. His face had gone grey, lips blue-tinged, skin cold despite the warmth inside the vehicle.
Through the rear window, she watched the tower collapse further. The middle floors gave way with a sound like thunder, imploding into the structure below, creating a debris cloud that spread across Beyoğlu. The landmark that had stood for six centuries, that had survived earthquakes and wars and the fall of empires, died in minutes.
The smoke column was visible across the entire city now. A funeral pyre for history. For choices. For the people who'd died because Malik wanted transcendence, and Aya's team had been forced to destroy an apparatus mid-activation.
Victory tasted like ash.
Omar made a sharp turn into a narrow street in the Fatih district, cut the lights, and pulled up outside an unmarked building.
"Basement," Omar said, already out of the vehicle. "I'll handle the doctor. You get him inside, then come back and help Amina."




The next hours existed in fragments.
A basement clinic in Fatih, harsh lights, and a doctor who asked no questions. Karim on a table, chest tube draining the blood that had been drowning him. The wet sound of it filling collection containers. Blood pressure dropping. Amina getting stitched and cleaned while she bit down on her belt, refusing anesthesia. Gunshots avoided major organs.
Then Omar's safehouse in Karaköy. Getting Karim up the stairs without killing him. Amina finally passing out on the couch after a blood transfusion.
Dawn was close when Aya finally stopped moving.
She stood in the doorway, watching Karim breathe moments after they got him moved into the safehouse bedroom. Each inhalation was a visible labor. Each exhalation seemed like it might be his last. His face was grey in the dim light, younger somehow in unconsciousness, stripped of the determination and guilt that had defined him since Morocco.
Omar appeared beside her, phone pressed to his ear. "Salah's on."
Aya took the phone and put it on speaker.
"Well, the whole world's talking about it already, front page news on the New York Times, too," Salah's voice crackled through. "Government statement blames the natural gas company. Structural failure, gas explosion, tragic accident."
"Casualties?" Aya asked.
"Eighty-seven confirmed dead so far. The number will rise as they clear rubble. Thousands injured. Three city blocks were damaged. But the narrative is clean: accident, not attack. Tragedy, not terrorism."
Aya moved to the living room where a television played news coverage on mute. Aerial footage showed the collapsed tower, the debris field, the fires still burning. A ticker at the bottom scrolled casualty numbers that climbed even as she watched.
Eighty-seven. Ninety-three. One hundred and four.
She unmuted the sound. A news anchor spoke in Turkish, voice professionally somber, explaining structural failure in a monument that had needed repairs for years. Engineering experts were brought on to discuss stress fractures and inadequate maintenance.
No mention of dimensional fractures. Of energy discharge. Of an ancient Ottoman apparatus designed to breach barriers between realities. The truth was already being buried under layers of comfortable lies.
"And Aegis?" Aya asked.
"Quiet, quiet. No official presence. I believe all operatives are extracted, eliminated, or dead. Malik is gone; you saw the chopper. He's in the wind. No trail."
Aya closed her eyes, exhaustion pulling at her. "We didn't stop him. This was all pointless. We helped him."
"You stopped the activation. You destroyed the apparatus. You saved Istanbul from immediate catastrophe."
"But we delivered the components he needed to him."
Silence on the line. Then Salah, quietly: "Yeah, but we didn’t know. It’s not your fault."
Aya ended the call and set the phone down. She turned to find Amina watching her from the kitchen doorway, two cups of tea in hand.
"Omar made tea. News says 104 dead now," Amina said, pacing slowly beside Aya and handing over a cup with effort. "Number's still climbing."
“You don’t need to be bringing me tea. Let me take care of you,” Aya said. “But thank you.”
Amina’s smile was soft, her eyes lingering gently, hazily. “Okay. I’d like that.”
They sat on the couch facing the window, Aya helping Amina sit down gingerly. They looked out at Istanbul spread below and the smoke column from Galata, a dark pillar against the sky.
"We did stop him, partially," Amina said. "We destroyed the array."
"Did we?" Aya's voice was flat. "104 people are dead. Leyla and Emre are buried under rubble. Karim might not survive the night. And Malik escaped with the crown lens." She faced Amina. "We saved Istanbul, but he's already moving to the next target."
"Then we go after him," Omar said from near Karim's door. "We find him. We finish it."
"Without Karim," Aya said. "Without our expert who actually understands my father's research."
"We manage," Omar said. "We improvise."
"Against Aegis. Against Malik with dimensional powers. Against an ancient system we don't understand." Aya's laugh was bitter. "Terrible odds."
"Yes," Amina agreed. "We have an idea of Malik’s plans, and we saw what happened to him. If we don't stop him, he becomes something beyond human, if he’s not already."
The weight settled over them. Three people, exhausted and wounded and facing impossible odds. But they weren't running.
Aya returned to staring out the window, looked out at Istanbul one more time. Millions of people down there, living their lives, unaware of how close they'd come to annihilation. Unaware that the battle had been won, but the war continued. Unaware that somewhere, something ancient and terrible waited to be activated by a man who'd already proven he'd sacrifice anything for his own power.
"Three days," she said quietly. "Then Amina will be ready to travel, and we give Karim time to stabilize. To survive the immediate crisis. Then we leave to chase Malik while he recovers."
"And if he doesn't survive?" Omar asked.
Aya's reflection in the window showed a woman she barely recognized. Older. Harder. Marked by choices that couldn't be unmade.
"Then we go anyway," she said. "And we finish this in his honor. Along with Abdelatif’s, Hamza’s, my father’s."
She turned away from the window, from Istanbul burning below, from the weight of 104 dead and rising.
"Get some rest," she told them. "Both of you. We'll need it for what's coming."
They dispersed. Amina to the sofa bed, Omar to make more calls, Aya to the chair beside Karim's bed. She sat in darkness, listening to his labored breathing, watching the rise and fall of his chest.
He'd worked to destroy the artifacts. Said the words, “Some things shouldn't exist.”
Now he lay broken while the man who'd perverted that work escaped with the key to something older, something more dangerous, something that waited in the images they’d glimpsed of flooded chambers beneath temples.
The night darkened, and Istanbul breathed. The casualties climbed on screen. And somewhere far away, Malik prepared for the winter solstice and transformation.
As Aya stood to stretch, her boot caught something on the floor beside the chair. A crumpled sheaf of papers, blood-spotted and singed at the edges, had spilled from Karim's tactical vest when they'd cut his clothes away. The doctor must have set them aside.
Aya gathered them automatically. They were badly damaged, some pages fused at the corners, others torn where Karim had grabbed them in haste. In the chaos of the tower, with bullets and dimensional fractures and Amina bleeding out across the room, he'd still had to risk time to preserve documents.
Typical.
She carried them to the window, where morning light would make the damaged text readable. Most were technical specifications. Energy calculations in Malik's precise hand. Schematics she couldn't decipher. Bureaucratic records from Aegis operations.
Then a photograph slipped free, and Aya's breath stopped.
Her father's face stared up at her.
Hassan Amrani stood in front of carved stone walls, pale and volcanic, carved into shallow niches the way Cappadocia’s cave sanctuaries were carved into the earth itself. The rock behind him held the faint geometry of hand-cut seams and recesses: alcoves for lamps, a low arched cut that suggested a doorway just out of frame, soot-darkened along the ceiling where fires had once burned. 
He was younger than she remembered, his beard still dark, his eyes bright with discovery. He wore field clothes, dusty and sweat-stained. Happy. Alive.
Beside him stood a much younger Malik Osman.
They had their arms around each other's shoulders. Brothers in scholarship. Partners in research. Two men who clearly trusted each other completely.
Aya turned the photograph over. Her father's handwriting, faded but unmistakable:
M.O., cheers to protecting what must be protected together, my fellow guardian, my brother. Long may the SM hold.
Guardian.
SM. The Silent Meridian.
Her father hadn't just studied these dangerous artifacts; he’d been a secret keeper. Like Hamza. Like Abdelatif. A protector of knowledge too dangerous to share. And Malik had been with him, before ideology split them apart, before whatever happened that turned research partners and best friends into mortal enemies.
The inscription on the carved walls behind them. Aya studied it more closely. An all-seeing eye with rays extending in every direction. The symbol her father had drawn in his notebooks. The one they’d followed through the bowels of Istanbul. Hassan had done the same, following the symbol of the Silent Meridian.
And Malik had been there with him, arm around his shoulders, smiling like a man who still believed in the same oath.
Aya stared until the symbol blurred, her mind fitting it into the night’s larger shape. Silent Meridian not as a myth, but as a network. Not one secret kept in one place, but many, distributed, protected by distance and misdirection.
If that mark existed here, how many others existed elsewhere?
How many had Malik already visited?
Aya's hands were shaking. She hadn't noticed until the photograph trembled.
She sank into the chair she'd vacated, photograph pressed against her chest, holding proof that her father's murder had been more personal than she'd ever imagined.
Not just a researcher killed for refusing to cooperate.
A guardian betrayed by his own partner.
Hassan had joined something. Had believed in something. The Silent Meridian that Çelebi had founded, which had protected dangerous, experimental knowledge for centuries. Her father had carried that torch. Had made choices about what the world, humanity, could handle and what must stay buried lest they tear themselves apart.
And Malik had been there for all of it. Had stood beside him. Had helped hide the very things he now sought to unleash.
What had changed? What had broken the partnership, the friendship, the shared purpose?
She didn't have answers. Just this photograph and two sentences in her father's handwriting. Evidence of a life she'd never known he lived.
The tears came without warning. Silent. Private. Mourning not just the father she'd lost but the father she'd never gotten to know. The secrets he'd kept. The choices he'd made. The guardian he'd been while she'd thought he was just an idealistic academic who loved old things.
"I understand now," she whispered to his image. "I think I finally understand."
Three days until departure.
The next countdown had begun.
And Aya sat in darkness, holding vigil over a broken man, knowing that whatever came next would likely kill them all, but choosing to go anyway because someone had to, and the alternative was unthinkable.
A soft knock at the door. Amina's silhouette in the dim light bled through from the hallway.
"Can't sleep either?" Amina's voice was rough. She'd been crying. The tear tracks were visible on her cheeks even in the darkness.
Aya shook her head. Held up the photograph.
Amina crossed the room slowly, favoring her left side, and took the chair opposite Karim's bed. She accepted the photograph, angled it toward the light from the doorway.
"That's your father?"
Aya nodded. "With Malik. Before everything."
Amina studied the image. The two men with their arms around each other. The carved walls behind them. She turned it over, read the inscription, and her breath caught.
"Guardians. The Silent Meridian."
"He was part of it. All along." Aya's voice cracked. "He wasn't just studying dangerous things. He was actively protecting them. Hiding them. Serving as a protector for humanity from elements of its own dangerous past.”
Amina was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was gentle. "Does that change how you see him?"
"I don't know." Aya wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand. "I spent years thinking he was just an academic. Someone who got too close to something dangerous and paid for it. But this… I mean, he chose this life. Chose secrecy. Chose to keep things from me. From everyone."
"He chose to protect."
"Did he?" The question came out sharper than intended. "Or did he just choose different secrets? How much better off would we be if he’d told me?"
Amina reached across the space between them, took Aya's hand. Her grip was warm, steady. Grounding.
"Look at his face in that photo," Amina said quietly. "That's not a man hiding from his choices. That's a man who knows exactly what he's doing and believes in it completely. Whatever the Silent Meridian was, or is, and whatever he did for them, he believed he was protecting something important."
"And Malik believed the same thing. Until he didn't."
"People change. Beliefs fracture. Partnerships end." Amina's thumb traced circles on Aya's palm. "But your father's choice, the one that got him killed, that wasn't weakness. That was integrity. He could have given Malik what he wanted. Could have traded his secrets for his life. He didn't."
Aya stared at the photograph. Her father's smile. His arm around the man who would eventually murder him. Two scholars who'd seen the same truths and drawn opposite conclusions.
"He died protecting something he thought was too dangerous to share," Aya said slowly. "And now Malik's trying to dig it up anyway."
"Which is why we're going to Cambodia. To finish what your father started."
"To be guardians ourselves."
"If that's what it takes."
Aya looked up and met Amina's eyes. In the dim light, with Karim's labored breathing filling the silence, she saw something there she'd been afraid to name. 
It was a deep understanding, like she’d never felt in her life. The kind that came from sharing wounds.
"Thank you," Aya whispered.
"For what?"
"For being here. For understanding why this matters. For not making me explain."
Amina's smile was soft. Sad. "You never have to explain. Not to me. That's how it works."
She released Aya's hand and stood slowly, wincing as her wounds protested before pausing at the door.
"Your father would be proud of you, Aya. The choices you've made. The person you've become. Whatever secrets he kept, I don't think he'd keep them from you now."
Then she was gone, leaving Aya alone with Karim's breathing and her father's face and the weight of legacies she was only beginning to understand.
"I'm not running," she whispered to the photograph. "You protected these secrets for years. I'll protect them now, just like I promised Hamza, too. Whatever it takes."
She tucked the photograph into her jacket, close to her heart, and settled deeper into the chair to wait for dawn.
Chapter 49
Aya woke to daylight streaming through windows she didn't recognize.
For three seconds, disorientation was total. Then memory crashed back: the tower, the collapse, Karim's broken body, Amina's blood trail across tilting stone. She was on a couch in Omar's safe house. At some point, she'd moved from the chair beside Karim's bed, couldn't remember when. She'd collapsed here around 3 AM, too exhausted to make it anywhere else.
Her body cataloged damage as consciousness returned. Bruises across her ribs where debris had struck her. Muscle strain in her shoulders from carrying two people down seven flights of stairs. Her throat raw from breathing smoke. Small injuries that would heal, unlike the ones Karim had sustained.
Karim.
She was on her feet before fully awake, moving toward the bedroom. The door was open. 
Inside, the doctor from the Fatih clinic sat beside the bed, checking monitors, adjusting IV lines. Karim lay exactly as they'd positioned him: elevated, chest tube draining into collection chambers, breathing shallow but steady.
"He's alive," she said, sensing Aya’s presence without turning. "Still unconscious but stable. Vital signs are improving. He's fighting."
Aya's shoulders dropped. "Prognosis?"
"Better than last night. Recovery will be long. Painful. He'll carry these injuries for life." The doctor stood, gathering equipment. "I'll return this evening. Monitor the drainage. Call if anything changes."
As the doctor left, Aya lingered in the doorway, watching Karim breathe. Some color was returning to skin that had been corpse-pale the last night. But he looked diminished. Younger. The earnest, principled scholar she’d met in the Atlas Mountains and recruited to her cause now reduced to a broken body and uncertain future.
She forced herself to turn away. To let him rest. To deal with the living while he fought his own battle.
The smell of coffee drew her toward the kitchen. Amina sat at the table, weapon components spread before her, fresh bandages visible where her shirt gaped. She was gripping the table edge for support, Aya noticed. Staying upright through willpower more than strength.
"He's stable," Aya said.
"Good. Omar's monitoring news." Amina's voice was rough. "You should see what's happening."
The command center was a converted bedroom filled with screens showing news feeds from multiple networks. Omar sat surrounded by monitors, all covering the same story.
The death toll had climbed overnight.
Three hundred and twelve confirmed dead. The number displayed across every screen, burned into Aya's vision even when she closed her eyes. 
Three hundred and twelve people who'd been going about their lives in Beyoğlu when dimensional forces tore through a medieval tower and brought it crashing down.
A live speech from the capital in Ankara filled the screen. Tragedy. Resilience. Structural failure. Gas explosion. Criminal negligence. Heads would roll.
No mention of trans-dimensional energy of Malik’s shadowy Aegis. No reference to ancient apparatuses or reality fractures. The truth was being systematically buried under comfortable lies.
"Aegis connections," Omar said quietly, "ensuring the real story never surfaces. Pays to be rich and have powerful people in your pocket. By tomorrow, the structural failure narrative will be concrete."
Faces of the dead began scrolling across the screen. Three hundred and twelve people reduced to photographs and names. Young and old. Turkish and foreign. Tourists and locals.
These people died because of choices made by her team, by Malik, by everyone involved in the hunt for Hassan's research. Collateral damage. But dead was dead regardless of intent.
"It would have been millions if you hadn't stopped the activation," Omar said, reading her expression.
Aya's voice was flat. "Tell that to the families of the three hundred and twelve."
Omar nodded once.
Aya turned away from the screens. Couldn't watch anymore. Couldn't process the faces, the names, the mathematics of tragedy.
She needed air.
Minutes later, she stood at the railing, hands wrapped around a cup of tea she didn't remember making, staring at the city without really seeing it.
The balcony was small, barely large enough for two people, overlooking Karaköy's industrial waterfront. Morning light painted the Golden Horn in shades of grey and gold. Istanbul spread out below, wounded but functioning, fifteen million people moving through their days while authorities cleared rubble from Beyoğlu.
The smoke from Galata had finally dissipated. But Aya could still see the scar: the gap in the skyline where the tower had stood watch for centuries.
The balcony door opened. Omar emerged carrying his own tea, joined her at the railing. They stood in silence for several minutes.
Finally, Omar spoke. "I didn't like her. I should have known."
Aya glanced at him. "Who?"
"Leyla." His voice was careful, measured. "Should have never trusted her.”
“I should have suspected her from the beginning,” Aya said with a shrug. “I had my doubts but never raised the alarm.” 
"Well, you weren't wrong. Never seem to be."
Aya took a sip of tea. "But I wasn't entirely right either. And I ended up doing the wrong thing. Sound familiar? I let my need for speed outrun my need for certainty. I left gaps she could exploit."
Silence. A boat horn sounded from the Golden Horn.
"She saved us at the end," Aya continued. "Her and Emre. Created the distraction that let Karim reach the array. We're alive because of her last choice."
"She also got Hamza killed." Omar's voice was hard. "She stole every component you recovered. She delivered everything to Malik. She was the reason the activation could even happen."
"Yes. All of that is true."
"So, which is she? Turncoat and villain, or hero?"
"Maybe both. Maybe just human." Aya turned to face him directly. "I don't know how to hold both truths either. But people are complicated. Making terrible choices and good choices and dying before anyone figures out which mattered more."
Aya set down her tea, gripped the railing with both hands before continuing. "She thought she was saving Emre. Believed that if she cooperated, she'd get him back and they'd disappear together."
"Do you think she still believed it at the end?"
Aya replayed the moment in her mind. Leyla's face when the Aegis transmission came through.
"No. I saw her face when she heard it. She knew they were both dead either way. That's when she chose to make it mean something. To die attacking Aegis instead of waiting to be executed."
"Very human," Omar agreed. "Flawed and terrified and choosing courage at the last possible moment."
"Is that enough? Does a noble death actually erase the damage?"
"I don't know. But I know she was terrified. I know she loved Emre enough to die with him. And I know she was young and made decisions under duress that I hope I'm never forced to make."
The weight of that settled between them.
"I'm not ready to forgive her," Aya said.
"Don't have to. Forgiveness is optional. But maybe carry her as a cautionary tale. About what fear makes people do. About impossible choices."
"And Emre?"
Omar was quiet for a moment. "He loved her enough to die for her. Stepped in front of that burst without hesitation, you said. Could have stayed behind cover. Could have let her fight her own battle. But he didn't."
"He might not have known everything she'd done."
"Would it have mattered?" Omar met her eyes. "Love doesn't ask for a clean record, Aya. It just asks."
"My dad would have said the same thing. That moral clarity is a luxury that only exists in the movies."
"Your father was wise."
"My father got murdered by his best friend, who thought he was pursuing progress, all in the name of this damned Astral Lens."
The parallel hung there, unspoken.
"I'm going to carry her," Aya said finally. "Not forgive. Just carry. Alongside Hamza and Abdelatif. Keep her in memory as a reminder that choices have consequences. That redemption is possible but expensive."
"That's all any of us can do. Carry the dead. Learn from them. Try not to make the same mistakes."
They stood watching Istanbul breathe below them. The city that had survived because of the choices made in the Galata Tower.
Somewhere in that city, Leyla and Emre were buried under tons of medieval stone. No proper burial. No recognition. Just bodies that would be recovered eventually, identified through dental records, mourned by families who'd never know the full truth.
“Aya,” Amina’s voice came through the glass sliding door as she tapped her knuckles. “Karim’s awake.”



His eyes opened. Closed. Opened again.
For a long moment, they were unfocused, lost somewhere between medication and memory. His gaze drifted to the ceiling, to the IV lines, to Aya's face without recognition. Then he surfaced. His cracked lips moved.
"Did..." A wet cough stopped him. He tried again, each word costing visible effort. "Did we..."
"We stopped the apparatus," Aya said quickly, sparing him. "The city's safe."
His eyes closed. Relief or exhaustion. When he spoke again, the words came in fragments, separated by labored breaths. "But he... got away."
"Yes. With the crown lens."
Silence. When he opened his eyes again, tears tracked down his face.
"Then it's not over."
"No. It's not over."
His good hand clutched weakly at the sheets. "I destroyed..." He stopped, gathering strength. "Hassan's work. Everything he..." Another pause, eyes closing. "I broke it."
"You also saved something." Aya pulled the photograph from her jacket, held it where he could see. "This was in the papers you grabbed. You didn't even know you'd taken it."
Karim's eyes focused on the image. Recognition flickered. "Your father..."
"With Malik. Years ago. Partners before they were enemies, both fighting the same fight as Hamza and Abdelatif. The Silent Meridian." She tucked it away again. "You decided it was worth it to grab some random papers in the middle of a firefight, and this is what was in them. Your instincts found what mattered."
A ghost of a smile crossed his damaged face. "Archaeologist reflexes."
"Something like that."
"And never forget, much more importantly, you saved Istanbul."
"Did I?" His eyes found hers, searching. "Or did I just destroy knowledge that could have changed everything?"
Aya leaned forward, took his good hand in both of hers. "Some knowledge must die, Karim. When you stood in that chamber with the pry bar raised and said those words, that was you completing part of my father's real work. Not preservation. Protection. Now I just need to finish the rest of it."
"I just keep second-guessing. Keep wondering if there was another way."
"There wasn't. The array was designed to breach dimensional barriers. Malik proved what it could do. It had to be destroyed. You did it. And it nearly killed you."
His hand squeezed hers weakly. "Cambodia. He was talking about Cambodia. Angkor Wat."
"He was."
"When..." He tried to shift position, and his face contorted. The medication was keeping the worst at bay, but movement still found the edges. "When do we leave?"
"Karim." Aya's hand tightened on his. "You're not going anywhere."
His eyes opened fully for the first time since waking. The confusion there broke her heart.
"The doctor says twelve weeks of recovery, minimum. You can barely breathe without assistance."
"Then we wait until I'm healed."
"We can't." Aya's grip on his hand tightened. "Malik has seventy days until the winter solstice. We can't afford to wait months. And even then, you might need a lot of rehab."
Understanding and grief crossed his face.
"You're going without me."
"We have to."
"You'll be missing the one who understands Hassan's research. Who can read the technical elements..."
"We'll manage."
"Aya, you can't—" He tried to sit up, failed, and collapsed back, gasping.
"Karim, listen to me." Her voice was gentle but firm. "You did your part. You destroyed the apparatus Malik spent years building. You proved that preservation instinct can be overridden when protection requires it. That's your legacy. That's enough."
"It doesn't feel like enough." Tears ran freely now. "It feels like I'm abandoning you. Abandoning Amina, Omar, Salah."
"You're not abandoning us. You're broken for now. There's a difference." Aya used her free hand to wipe tears from his face. "And you're giving us the tools to finish what you started. The understanding that some things shouldn't exist. The courage to destroy rather than preserve."
Long silence. Just holding hands while Karim processed.
Finally, his voice barely audible: "Promise..." He stopped, breathing through pain. "Promise me."
"Anything."
It took him three attempts to get the words out, each sentence a separate battle. "Whatever he's building in Cambodia. You destroy it." A cough, wet and rattling. "Completely. Every trace of this." His grip tightened with surprising strength. "Everyone who works with Aegis. You destroy them, too."
The weight of that request settled over Aya. He was asking her to guarantee Malik's death.
"I promise."
"Say it fully. So I know you mean it."
Aya met his eyes. Saw the desperation there.
"I promise that whatever Malik is building in Cambodia, I will destroy it completely. No preservation. No study. No second chances. And I will stop Malik and his people permanently. Whatever that requires."
The final words hung between them. Whatever that requires. The implicit understanding that stopping Malik permanently meant killing him.
Karim nodded. "Then I can rest, knowing you'll finish it."
Aya squeezed his hand.
“And, Aya. I know there’s no us, and hasn’t been for some time now, but I still hope there can be someday. I’ll always care about you.”
His eyes closed, exhaustion claiming him. The painkillers pulling him under.
Aya sat holding his hand until his breathing settled into the slow rhythm of sleep. Until his grip relaxed. Until she was certain he couldn't hear her.
"I’ll always care about you, too. More than I can put into words. But some things shouldn't exist," she whispered. "You taught me that."
She released his hand. Stood. Looked at the man who’d been amazing enough to make her doubt everything. To turn her into the better version of herself.
He looked peaceful somehow. As if making her promise had lifted a weight he'd been carrying since Morocco.
Aya turned and left him sleeping.



The afternoon passed in fragments. Equipment checks. Calls to contacts who owed favors. The weight of Karim's words settled into places Aya wasn't ready to examine.
She'd cared about him. Still did. But somewhere between Morocco and Istanbul, between djinn fire and dimensional fractures, she'd stopped pretending that caring was the same as wanting. That comfort was the same as hunger.
Evening found them at the dining table with weapons that needed maintenance. Aya had claimed one end, spreading cleaning supplies and disassembled components across the scarred wood.
When Amina emerged from the bedroom, Aya's hands stopped moving on the rifle.
Amina had stripped down to black underwear and a sports bra.
"I'm sick of ruining clothes," she said, catching Aya's look as she crossed to the table. Matter-of-fact. "Every time I change the bandages, another shirt gets blood on it. This is easier."
The bandage over her gunshot wound stood out stark white against her tan skin. Practical, yes. But it meant that when she sat across the table and began field-stripping her own weapon, Aya had an unobstructed view of her chest and shoulders. The long lines of her bare legs beneath the table. The curve of her hip where black cotton met skin.
Aya kept her eyes on her work. Disassemble. Clean. Lubricate. Reassemble.
They worked in silence for several minutes, the only sounds the mechanical clicks of weapons being serviced.
"You're staring," Amina said without looking up.
"I'm not."
"You are." Amina's lips curved. She set down the weapon she'd been cleaning, looked up, and met Aya's eyes directly. "I was terrified."
The topic shift snapped Aya's full attention up. "When?"
"In the tower. Getting shot, fighting without the enhanced senses, the strength, the healing factor from the djinn power." Amina's hands had stopped working. "In that chamber, I thought my luck had run out."
"You did incredible."
"I got shot three times." Amina's hand moved to her side, pressed against the bandage. "Felt my mortality in ways I never had before."
Aya stood without planning to, moved around the table without thinking it through. Sat beside Amina instead of across from her, close enough to see the exhaustion in her eyes, the fading bruises on her jaw from the tower collapse.
Close enough to feel the heat radiating from her skin. Close enough to see the goosebumps rise on Amina's bare arms.
"You proved something," Aya said quietly, forcing herself to maintain eye contact instead of letting her gaze drift lower. "To yourself. That you're enough."
"I did." Amina turned to face her, their knees touching now, the space between them measured in inches. Bare thigh against Aya's clothed leg. This close, Aya could see the scar on her shoulder from Morocco, could smell gun oil and the faint scent of her shampoo, could see the pulse jumping in the hollow of her throat.
Her hand came up, rested against Aya's chest. Not pushing away. Just touching. Feeling the heartbeat beneath her palm. Her fingers spread slowly, palm pressing flatter, feeling more.
"And I proved something else," Amina continued, her voice dropping lower. "That I want there to be an after. That I want to survive Cambodia and come back and have the conversation we've been avoiding since Morocco."
Aya's breath caught. Amina's hand was warm through her shirt, grounding and electric simultaneously. Her skin was right there: shoulder, collarbone, the hollow of her throat where pulse beat visibly, the swell of her breasts above the sports bra. It would take nothing to close the distance. To finally stop pretending she didn't want this.
"Amina..."
"I know. Mission first. Focus. Survival." Amina's thumb moved against Aya's collarbone, a small circling motion that sent heat down Aya's spine. "But after. If we survive Cambodia."
Aya wanted to close the distance. Wanted to lean in and kiss her right here at this table. Wanted to slide her hands along her bare thighs, pull her closer, stop deferring and denying, and take what they both clearly wanted.
But Karim was unconscious in the next room. Omar was in the command center. And in seventy-one days, they'd be facing something that would probably kill them both.
So instead of kissing her, Aya reached up and covered Amina's hand with her own. Pressed it more firmly against her chest. Let Amina feel her heart racing.
"If we survive Cambodia," Aya said, each word deliberate, "we can figure out what we are. I promise. And I think that future is glorious."
"Good." Amina's eyes dropped to Aya's mouth, lingered, then dragged back up with visible effort. "Now let's make sure we survive."
She pulled her hand away slowly, fingers trailing across Aya's collarbone before breaking contact. Then returned to the weapon in front of her.
They worked in silence for several minutes, but the air between them hummed.
"We need contacts," Amina said finally, not looking up from the barrel she was cleaning. "Cambodia's not Morocco. We don't know the terrain, the players. Without Karim..."
"I know."
"What about Beckett?"
Aya's hands stilled on the rifle stock. She hadn't heard that name spoken aloud in years. "We never called him. Never came to his side. That was the deal he offered, and we walked away."
"He knew Southeast Asia better than anyone. Twenty years, he said." Amina's voice was carefully neutral. "And he found us in Phuket when no one else could."
"That was a long time ago." Aya resumed cleaning, the mechanical motion grounding her. "He could be dead. Retired. Burned. Or he remembers two thieves who took his number and never used it."
"You still have it?"
"Somewhere." She did. Transferred from phone to phone across years and continents, never deleted, never dialed. A door she'd kept cracked without ever walking through.
"Might be worth finding out if he answers."
Aya thought of Beckett watching them flee the club in Phuket. His expression was unreadable across the chaos. The encrypted phone he'd slid across a café table three days later. Use it when you want to come to the other side.
They'd chosen their own side instead. And now that side had a body count.
"I'll think about it," Aya said.
Amina nodded and reached across the table for a cleaning cloth. As she did, her sports bra rode up, momentarily exposing the underside of her breast, forcing Aya to physically look away.
Not the time. Not the place. Not when Cambodia waited, and death was probable. But her body didn't care about timing or probability. Her body just wanted.
Aya quickly finished reassembling her rifle, checked the action, and loaded a fresh magazine, pushing aside all other thoughts.
Omar appeared in the doorway, phone pressed to his ear.
"Well, well, don’t mind me,” Omar said, a comically large grin spreading across his face. “Salah has the complete intelligence package ready. Full briefing tomorrow morning. He's been tracking since the tower fell, thinks he has a hit."
Aya and Amina exchanged glances.
"Tomorrow," Aya said. "Then we plan. Then we go, as soon as possible."
Omar nodded and retreated backward, shuffling into his command center. “I’ll just leave you two be…”
Amina stood, collecting her guns. At the doorway, she paused. Looked back.
"For after," she said quietly.
"For after," Aya agreed.
Then Amina was gone, and Aya sat alone at the table, the taste of anticipation sharp on her tongue, wondering if "after" would ever come.
Chapter 50
The next morning, they gathered in Omar’s makeshift command center to learn exactly what they were walking into.
Karim slept in the next room, his breathing steady through the closed door. Alive. Stable. But still unconscious more often than not. The doctor had been by earlier, declared his condition improved enough that survival was probable. Recovery would take months.
Aya sat at the table surrounded by screens, Amina to her left, Omar at the controls. On the largest monitor, Salah's face looked tired. The exhaustion that came from days without sleep, fueled by coffee and determination, and the knowledge that people's lives depended on the intelligence he could gather.
"My people, I’m just going to toss us right into the game. I've been tracking Aegis communications since the tower fell," he said without preamble. "They're not hiding their movements well. Either they're confident no one can stop them, or they're rushed. Maybe both."
His screen split, showing flight paths. "Malik's extraction was textbook. Private jet from Istanbul to Athens, then Bangkok, then Siem Reap in Cambodia. He arrived about fourteen hours ago."
A pin dropped on the map. Angkor Archaeological Park.
"He's not alone." Satellite imagery appeared, showing movement patterns around the temple complex. "They've been staging there for at least three weeks. Before Istanbul."
The implication hit like cold water.
"He knew," Aya said quietly. "Istanbul was never the endgame."
"No. It was proof of concept." Salah pulled up new documents. "I got curious about the connection and found Ottoman records referencing travelers who returned from the Khmer Empire with knowledge of mortal rulers they claimed had been transformed into divine beings. I’m guessing the lens Çelebi built wasn't an invention. It was a recreation or utilization of something much older."
"And the original is still there," Amina said. "Under Angkor Wat."
"No clue, but Malik's down there now."
"What about Malik himself?" Aya asked. "His condition?"
Salah hesitated. "I’m shut out on comms right now. Aegis must have figured someone was in their system and changed protocol." He paused. "But if what you said about the alignment is related to what I read, and this shit isn’t metaphorical, he's becoming something that can channel dimensional energy directly. A living lens."
"How do we stop that?"
Salah's face was grave. "I’ll send you this report; probably best if Karim takes a look. But, from what I can tell, if he pulls his ritual off, then he becomes something we might not be able to stop. Reality manipulation. Shaping and controlling matter itself."
"A god," Amina said flatly.
"Trippy, but yeah, by any meaningful definition.”
The silence was heavy.
"So we have seventy days," Omar said. "To infiltrate an active UNESCO site with thousands of tourists, avoid Aegis operatives who will actually be looking to eliminate us this time, find where Malik is planning this ritual, and stop a man who's already partially non-corporeal."
"Yes,” Aya said.
"That's suicide."
"Probably." Aya met his eyes. "But the alternative is letting him win because the odds were too bad."
Omar held her gaze for a long moment. Then he stood.
"I'm going with you."
"Omar—"
"No. Don't argue." His voice was firm. "I'm no fighter. I know that. But I'm the reason you actual badasses are alive. Every extraction since Morocco, every safe house, every resource. Intelligence. Coordination. Logistics. Escape routes. Being your minister of the underworld. That's what I do. And you'll need it in Cambodia more than ever."
"It's probably a one-way trip. Even if we succeed, extraction might not be possible."
"Then I die doing something that matters, like the old man. You two go ahead and get on the ground. I’ll hang back until Karim can get back to Morocco, then I’ll rendezvous in Cambodia."
Amina stood as well. "He's right. We need him. We can't infiltrate Angkor Wat, locate the chambers, avoid Aegis security, destroy the system, and extract without dedicated logistical support."
Aya looked at her team. Really looked.
Amina, wounded but functional, supernatural abilities gone, but human competence elite beyond anyone else.
Omar, non-combatant but essential, the coordinator who'd kept them alive across two countries.
Herself, exhausted, haunted by three hundred and twelve dead, carrying promises made to Karim and Hassan's memory.
Three people against Malik’s Aegis corporation. Against Malik with powers they couldn't fully counter. Against an ancient system they didn't understand.
"They’re bad odds," Omar said, reading her expression.
"I've faced worse," Amina said. Then paused. "No. Actually, I haven't. These might be the worst odds yet."
Aya smiled. "Then let's make them count."
She turned to Salah on the screen. "Start preparing. I need everything you’ve found on the Khmer rituals. And on Angkor Wat. Architectural plans, including underground chamber maps. Security patterns. Tourist schedules for December. Water levels. Entry documents. Weapons sources. Medical supplies. Multiple extraction routes."
"Already compiling, okti. Complete package within forty-eight hours if I have enough coffee."
"Good. We leave in two days. That gives Karim more time to stabilize."
The call ended. The screens went dark except for the satellite image of Angkor Wat: the distinctive five-tower silhouette rising from the Cambodian jungle, innocent and beautiful and hiding machinery designed to transform human consciousness.
Somewhere, Malik was preparing. Learning the original system. Counting down days.
"Two days," Aya said quietly. "We rest. We heal. We prepare."

Dawn, two days later.
Aya stood on the roof of Omar's safe house, watching Istanbul wake. She hadn't slept. The hours between midnight and sunrise had been spent at the railing, watching the city breathe below, processing everything that had happened and everything that was coming.
Rubble was still being cleared in the distance. But the city itself survived. Wounded but functioning. That was something.
Two days had bought Karim stability and bought them intel. But Aya was itching to move.
The rooftop door opened behind her. She knew the footsteps: light, careful, favoring the left side where the gunshot wound was still healing.
Amina joined her at the railing, carrying two cups of coffee, and handed one over without speaking. They stood in silence, watching the sun climb above the Asian shore of the Bosphorus.
The light was beautiful and warm.
Minutes passed. The coffee was good. Strong and bitter.
"Ninety minutes," Amina said finally. "Then we're headed for a plane."
"Yes."
"Might not come back."
"Probably won't."
Amina set down her coffee. Turned to face Aya fully.
"Then I'm not waiting for 'after,’ habibi."
She kissed her.
Not gentle. This was hunger barely leashed, weeks of denial breaking through. Amina's mouth was demanding, her hand in Aya's hair, and Aya's body responded before her mind caught up. Hands grabbing Amina's waist, pulling her closer, meeting intensity with intensity.
Instead of soft, it was fire.
When they finally broke apart, both breathing hard, Amina's eyes were dark and fierce.
"That," she said, voice rough, "is what I want to come back for."
Aya's heart was hammering. The taste of Amina was still on her lips.
"A promise," Amina said. "Something to survive for."
"I can't guarantee I'll come back."
"Neither can I." Amina leaned in again, but this time the kiss was gentler. When she pulled back, her expression was serious. "But now we both have a reason to try."
She stepped away, and Aya felt the loss like cold air.
"Now we should go inside," Amina said. "Before I forget, we have a plane to catch."
Aya's laugh was shaky. "Probably wise."
But when Amina moved toward the door, Aya caught her hand. Pulled her back for one more kiss. Quick, fierce.
"For after," Aya said against her mouth.
"For after," Amina agreed.

The car arrived at nine. Omar loaded bags while Aya took one last look at the bedroom where Karim slept.
Karim was awake, watching her from the pillows. Color had returned to his face. His breathing was steady.
Their eyes met. Everything that needed saying had been said. The promise. The goodbye. The understanding that this might be the last time.
Karim held her gaze. "Finish it.”
Aya nodded once through a smile. Then she was gone.
She walked down to the street where Omar and Amina waited beside the car.
Istanbul spread out around them.
"Ready?" Omar asked.
Aya looked at her team. At the city they'd saved. At the sky stretching toward Southeast Asia, and what waited in flooded chambers beneath ancient temples.
"Let's go put that bastard in the ground," she said.
Amina grinned. 
Omar opened the door, and they drove toward the airport, toward Cambodia, toward whatever ending waited for them in the shadows.















4
Two weeks later.
Angkor Wat Temple Complex, Siem Reap, Cambodia.
Dawn broke in layers. First gray, then amber, then sudden gold that painted sandstone towers and turned flooded barays into mirrors of fire.
Malik stood at the edge of the western baray, boots sunk in red mud, watching the water it contained move in patterns that had nothing to do with wind.
He looked down at his hands, which glowed in the growing light. They'd taken on a faint luminescence that pulsed with his heartbeat. The veins showed too clearly beneath translucent skin, glowing like circuitry. Beautiful in its corruption.
He pulled the crown lens from his pack, felt its weight, felt the energy still pulsing through its crystalline structure. The partial activation had charged it, filled it with cosmic power that was now slowly filling him, transforming him, killing and remaking him in equal measure.
In Istanbul, it had shown him things. Memories encoded in its structure. Not Çelebi's memories. Older. Khmer artisans crafting an original. Malik’s lens wasn't the invention. It was the imitation.
The Devaraja system was the source.
He replaced the crown lens in its padded holster and extracted a charcoal rubbing from his pack. A stone inscription captured from a closed section of the Bayon temple's inner sanctum. The Khmer script was archaic, but the translation was clear:
“When the seven-headed serpent drinks from the sky, when waters rise, and stars align, the God-King shall ascend. Not through stone or bronze or the light of distant suns, but through faith itself made manifest. The vessel must be willing. The vessel must bridge realms already torn.”
He and Hassan had spent over twenty years studying the Ottoman lens system, convinced that focusing energy from deep space was the key, an alien technology. But the Ottomans had only copied Khmer techniques, and they'd missed the essential element.
The true power source wasn't celestial. It wasn’t alien. It was human.
It was consciousness itself. Belief made real through architecture designed to amplify, concentrate, and control human will.
Malik's phone vibrated. 
Message from Jakarta station: Perimeter established. Standing by for solstice preparation.
He typed his response with fingers that clicked slightly as crystalline bone scraped: Begin hydraulic surveys. Monitor Bangkok. If Aya's team moves, I want advance notice.
The water in the baray rippled, and Malik saw his reflection distort, saw what he was becoming. The Istanbul activation had started the transformation, but couldn't finish it.
But the Devaraja system could. It didn't require lenses or calculations. It merely required faith made manifest and a conscious anchor. Someone who'd already touched one of the boundaries between realms and survived.
Aya Amrani destroyed the apparatus, but I have what matters, Malik thought. The lens remembers everything.



Three hundred feet below the temple complex, in chambers flooded for eight hundred years, something stirred.
The water moved first. Currents organized into spirals that suggested intention rather than physics. Silt disturbed from the bottom formed patterns: Naga coils, seven-headed serpent configurations.
The stone carvings lining the chamber walls had been dark since the temple's abandonment. Now they began to glow. Faint at first, barely visible golden light.
Something vast shifted in the flooded darkness.
It had been sleeping. Waiting. The Khmer kings who'd built the temples had understood: you couldn't force transcendence. You could only create the conditions and wait for the alignment to converge naturally.
Eight hundred years of waiting.
And now, for the first time since Jayavarman's death, the conditions were approaching again. The temples would conduct like lightning rods conducted electricity.
The presence reached outward through channels carved into reality during centuries of ceremony. Through the network of temples. Through stone and water and earth.
The golden light in the flooded chamber grew brighter, calling across three thousand miles of ocean.
Come, the waters seemed to whisper. Come home. Complete what was started. Become what you're meant to be.
The Naga carvings' eyes gleamed in the darkness.
Malik looked up from his phone toward the western baray, where the dawn light caught something moving beneath the surface. Ripples collected into patterns. Seven circles, spiraling outward.
The water glowed faintly. He smiled despite the wrongness.
The Devaraja system was waking, responding to the charged lens, to his transformation, to the approaching solstice.
"Two months," Malik whispered to the dawn. "Then I complete what I started. What my Aegis brothers have worked and died for."
He looked down at the crown lens in his glowing hands, felt its power resonating with whatever waited below.
"When Aya comes to stop me, and she will come, she'll find I've already transcended everything her father feared. And she will be forced to hand over what I need from her."
The water rippled again. The Naga eyes gleamed beneath the surface.
The solstice was coming, and in the flooded chambers below, something ancient began to dream of a consciousness it could finally inhabit.
