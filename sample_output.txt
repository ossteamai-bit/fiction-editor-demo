CONCEPT ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

Word Count: 575

Paragraph Count: 35

Opening Concept: Chapter 1 The Istanbul skyline burned orange in the dying light. Aya Amrani stood at the window of her hotel room, watching the minarets pierce the sky like ancient sentinels. She'd been here three days. Three days of dead ends, false leads, and questions that led nowhere. Her phone buzzed. A text from Amina: "Found something. Galata Tower. Tonight." Tonight. Always tonight with Amina. Never tomorrow, never next week. Always right now, this instant, immediately. Aya smiled despite herself. That's what she loved about her friend. That urgency. That absolute refusal to wait. She grabbed her jacket—leather, worn, comfortable—and headed for the door. The corridor smelled of cardamom and old cigarettes. Istanbul smelled like memory, she thought. Like every place you've ever been layered on top of every place you'll ever go. The taxi driver didn't speak English. Aya's Turkish was rusty but functional. "Galata Kulesi," she said. He nodded, pulled into traffic without looking. Istanbul traffic was chaos theory made manifest. Every driver believed they could squeeze through gaps that didn't exist. Every intersection was a negotiation conducted at high speed with insufficient brakes. Aya held the door handle and tried not to think about mortality. Chapter 2 Galata Tower rose before her like a medieval monument to human stubbornness. How many times had she been here? Five? Six? She'd lost count. Each time it looked different. Each time it looked the same. Amina waited at the base, practically vibrating with excitement. "Aya! Finally! Look at this!" She thrust a photograph at Aya—old, sepia-toned, creased along the edges. It showed Galata Tower, but different. Younger. A date scrawled on the back: 1923. "Where'd you get this?" Aya asked. "The archives. The government archives. Took me three days to find it. Look at the base. See that?" Aya looked. At the bottom of the tower, barely visible, was a doorway. A doorway that didn't exist anymore. Or did it? "We need to get in there," Amina said. "It's closed. Tower closes at sunset." "Since when has that stopped us?" Since never. That was the answer. Since never had that stopped them. Chapter 3 The tower guard was named Mehmet. Or maybe he wasn't. Maybe that was just what he told tourists. He had kind eyes and a skeptical smile. "Tower is closed," he said in careful English. "I know," Aya replied in Turkish. "We're researchers. We have a permit." They didn't have a permit. They'd never had a permit. But confidence sold lies better than hesitation sold truth. Mehmet looked at them. Looked at the empty plaza. Looked at his watch. Sighed the sigh of a man who didn't get paid enough to care. "Twenty minutes," he said. "That's it. Twenty minutes." Inside, the tower spiraled upward into darkness. The stone walls pressed close. Each step echoed like history repeating itself. "Down," Amina whispered. "We need to go down." "There is no down," Aya said. "Tower doesn't have a basement." "The photo shows a door. Doors lead somewhere." Logic that
